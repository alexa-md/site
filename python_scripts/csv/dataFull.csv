"However, if it affects your legs, you may waddle when you walk",Myasthenia gravis
"If your neck is weak, it may be hard to hold up your head",Myasthenia gravis
"In myasthenia gravis, your immune system produces antibodies that block or destroy many of your muscles' receptor sites for a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine (as-uh-teel-KOH-leen)",Myasthenia gravis
"With fewer receptor sites available, your muscles receive fewer nerve signals, resulting in weakness",Myasthenia gravis

"This protein is involved in forming the nerve-muscular junction",Myasthenia gravis
"When antibodies block the function of this protein, it may lead to myasthenia gravis",Myasthenia gravis
"Research continues to study how the antibodies inhibiting this protein are related to the development of myasthenia gravis",Myasthenia gravis
"Thymus gland Researchers believe that the thymus gland, a part of your immune system situated in the upper chest beneath your breastbone, may trigger or maintain the production of the antibodies that block acetylcholine",Myasthenia gravis
"Large in infancy, the thymus is small in healthy adults",Myasthenia gravis
"In some adults with myasthenia gravis, however, the thymus is abnormally large",Myasthenia gravis

"Children with NF1 often are below average in height",Neurofibromatosis
"Neurofibromatosis 2 Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is much less common than NF1",Neurofibromatosis
"Signs and symptoms of NF2 usually result from the development of benign, slow-growing tumors (acoustic neuromas) in both ears",Neurofibromatosis
"Also known as vestibular schwannomas, these tumors grow on the nerve that carries sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain",Neurofibromatosis
"Signs and symptoms generally appear in the late teen and early adult years, and can vary in severity",Neurofibromatosis
"Signs and symptoms can include: Gradual hearing loss Ringing in the ears Poor balance Headaches Sometimes NF2 can lead to the growth of schwannomas in other nerves of the body, including the cranial, spinal, visual (optic) and peripheral nerves",Neurofibromatosis
"Signs and symptoms of these schwannomas can include: Numbness and weakness in the arms or legs Pain Balance difficulties Facial drop Vision problems or the development of cataracts Schwannomatosis This rare type of neurofibromatosis usually affects people after the age of 20",Neurofibromatosis
"Schwannomatosis causes tumors to develop on skull (cranial), spinal and peripheral nerves — but not on the nerve that carries sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain",Neurofibromatosis
"Because tumors don't usually grow on both hearing nerves, schwannomatosis doesn't cause the hearing loss experienced by people with NF2",Neurofibromatosis

"The tumors associated with neurofibromatosis are often benign and slow growing",Neurofibromatosis
"So although it's important to obtain a timely diagnosis, the situation isn't an emergency",Neurofibromatosis
"The specific genes involved depend on the type of neurofibromatosis: NF1",Neurofibromatosis
"The NF1 gene is located on chromosome 17",Neurofibromatosis
"This gene normally produces a protein called neurofibromin that helps regulate cell growth",Neurofibromatosis
"The mutated gene causes a loss of neurofibromin, which allows cells to grow uncontrolled",Neurofibromatosis
"NF2",Neurofibromatosis
"The NF2 gene is located on chromosome 22, and produces a protein call merlin",Neurofibromatosis
"The mutated gene causes a loss of merlin, leading to uncontrolled cell growth",Neurofibromatosis
"Schwannomatosis",Neurofibromatosis
"So far, two genes are known to cause schwannomatosis",Neurofibromatosis
"About half of people with NF1 and NF2 inherited the disease",Neurofibromatosis
"NF1 and NF2 that isn't inherited results from new gene mutations",Neurofibromatosis
"NF1 and NF2 are both autosomal dominant disorders, which means that any child of a parent with the disorder has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the genetic mutation",Neurofibromatosis
"The inheritance pattern for schwannomatosis is less clear",Neurofibromatosis
"Researchers currently estimate that the risk of inheriting schwannomatosis from an affected parent is about 15 percent",Neurofibromatosis
"Generally, complications result from tumor growth distorting nerve tissue or pressing on internal organs",Neurofibromatosis
"Learning and thinking difficulties are the most common neurological problem associated with NF1",Neurofibromatosis
"Uncommon complications include epilepsy and buildup of excess fluid in the brain",Neurofibromatosis
"Concerns with appearance",Neurofibromatosis
"Visible signs of neurofibromatosis — such as extensive cafe au lait spots, numerous neurofibromas in the facial area or large neurofibromas — can cause anxiety and emotional distress, even if they're not medically serious",Neurofibromatosis

"The cause is unknown",Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
"However, if your family has one child with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the risk of having another with a similar condition is increased",Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
"A normal heart has four chambers, two on the right and two on the left",Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
"In performing its basic job — pumping blood throughout the body — the heart uses its left and right sides for different tasks",Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
"The right side moves blood to the lungs",Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
"In the lungs, oxygen enriches the blood, which then circulates to the heart's left side",Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
"The left side of the heart pumps blood into a large vessel called the aorta, which circulates the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body",Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
"What happens in hypoplastic left heart syndrome In hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the left side of the heart can't properly supply blood to the body because the lower left chamber (left ventricle) is too small or in some cases it may not even exist",Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
"In addition, the valves on the left side of the heart (aortic valve and mitral valve) don't work properly, and the main artery leaving the heart (aorta) is smaller than normal",Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
"For the first several days of life, the right side of the heart can pump blood both to the lungs and to the rest of the body through a blood vessel that connects the pulmonary artery directly to the aorta (ductus arteriosus)",Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
"The oxygen-rich blood returns to the right side of the heart through a natural opening (foramen ovale) between the right chambers of the heart (atria)",Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
"When the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus are open, they are referred to as being patent",Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
"If the ductus arteriosus and the foramen ovale close — which they normally do after the first day or two of life — the right side of the heart has no way to pump blood out to the body",Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
"Keeping these connections open is necessary for survival in the first few days of life in babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome",Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
"This will keep blood flowing to the body until the first surgical procedure is performed",Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
"Beyond family history, there are no clear risk factors for hypoplastic left heart syndrome",Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
"With treatment, many babies survive, although most will have complications later in life",Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
"Some of the complications may include:",Hypoplastic left heart syndrome

"People occasionally catch diphtheria from handling an infected person's used tissues, drinking from the infected person's unwashed glass or coming into similarly close contact with other items on which bacteria-laden secretions may be deposited",Diphtheria
"Contaminated household items",Diphtheria
"In rare cases, diphtheria spreads on shared household items, such as towels or toys",Diphtheria
"You can also come in contact with diphtheria-causing bacteria by touching an infected wound",Diphtheria
"People who have been infected by the diphtheria bacteria and who haven't been treated can infect nonimmune people for up to six weeks — even if they don't show any symptoms",Diphtheria
"However, diphtheria is still common in developing countries where immunization rates are low",Diphtheria
"In areas where diphtheria vaccination is standard, the disease is mainly a threat to unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated people who travel internationally or have contact with people from less-developed countries",Diphtheria
"Diphtheria-causing bacteria may produce a toxin",Diphtheria
"This toxin damages tissue in the immediate area of infection — usually, the nose and throat",Diphtheria
"At that site, the infection produces a tough, gray-colored membrane composed of dead cells, bacteria and other substances",Diphtheria
"This membrane can obstruct breathing",Diphtheria
"Heart damage",Diphtheria
"The diphtheria toxin may spread through your bloodstream and damage other tissues in your body, such as your heart muscle, causing such complications as inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis)",Diphtheria
"Heart damage from myocarditis may be slight, showing up as minor abnormalities on an electrocardiogram, or severe, leading to congestive heart failure and sudden death",Diphtheria
"Nerve damage",Diphtheria
"The toxin can also cause nerve damage",Diphtheria
"Typical targets are nerves to the throat, where poor nerve conduction may cause difficulty swallowing",Diphtheria
"Nerves to the arms and legs also may become inflamed, causing muscle weakness",Diphtheria
"If C",Diphtheria
"diphtheria toxin damages the nerves that help control muscles used in breathing, these muscles may become paralyzed",Diphtheria
"Respiration may then become impossible without a respirator or another device to assist with breathing",Diphtheria
"With treatment, most people with diphtheria survive these complications, but recovery is often slow",Diphtheria
"Diphtheria is fatal in as many as 3 percent of those who get the disease",Diphtheria

"Untreated, urinary problems might lead to obstruction of the urinary tract",Enlarged prostate
"If you're unable to pass any urine, seek immediate medical attention",Enlarged prostate
"This process involves the following steps: The brain starts the process",Precocious puberty
"Part of the brain makes a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH)",Precocious puberty
"The pituitary gland releases more hormones",Precocious puberty
"Gn-RH causes the pituitary gland — a small bean-shaped gland at the base of your brain — to release two more hormones",Precocious puberty
"The hormones are called luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)",Precocious puberty
"Sex hormones are produced",Precocious puberty
"LH and FSH cause the ovaries to produce hormones involved in the growth and development of female sexual characteristics (estrogen) and the testicles to produce hormones responsible for the growth and development of male sexual characteristics (testosterone)",Precocious puberty
"Physical changes occur",Precocious puberty
"The production of estrogen and testosterone causes the physical changes of puberty",Precocious puberty
"Why this process begins early in some children depends on whether they have central precocious puberty or peripheral precocious puberty",Precocious puberty
"Central precocious puberty There's usually no identifiable cause for this type of precocious puberty",Precocious puberty
"In central precocious puberty, the puberty process starts too soon",Precocious puberty
"The pattern and timing of the steps in the process are otherwise normal",Precocious puberty
"For the majority of children with this condition, there's no underlying medical problem and no identifiable reason for the early puberty",Precocious puberty
"In rare cases, the following may cause central precocious puberty: A tumor in the brain or spinal cord (central nervous system) A defect in the brain present at birth, such as excess fluid buildup (hydrocephalus) or a noncancerous tumor (hamartoma) Radiation to the brain or spinal cord Injury to the brain or spinal cord McCune-Albright syndrome — a rare genetic disease that affects bones and skin color and causes hormonal problems Congenital adrenal hyperplasia — a group of genetic disorders involving abnormal hormone production by the adrenal glands Hypothyroidism — a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones Peripheral precocious puberty Estrogen or testosterone in your child's body causes this type of precocious puberty",Precocious puberty
"The less common peripheral precocious puberty occurs without the involvement of the hormone in your brain (Gn-RH) that normally triggers the start of puberty",Precocious puberty
"Instead, the cause is release of estrogen or testosterone into the body because of problems with the ovaries, testicles, adrenal glands or pituitary gland",Precocious puberty
"In both girls and boys, the following may lead to peripheral precocious puberty: A tumor in the adrenal glands or in the pituitary gland that secretes estrogen or testosterone McCune-Albright syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin color and bones and causes hormonal problems Exposure to external sources of estrogen or testosterone, such as creams or ointments In girls, peripheral precocious puberty may also be associated with: Ovarian cysts Ovarian tumors In boys, peripheral precocious puberty may also be caused by: A tumor in the cells that make sperm (germ cells) or in the cells that make testosterone (Leydig cells) Gene mutation — a rare disorder called gonadotropin-independent familial sexual precocity, which is caused by a defect in a gene, can result in the early production of testosterone in boys, usually between ages 1 and 4",Precocious puberty

"Even if you aren't sure whether you've been bitten, seek medical attention",Rabies
"For instance, a bat that flies into your room while you're sleeping may bite you without waking you",Rabies
"If you awake to find a bat in your room, assume you've been bitten",Rabies
"Also, if you find a bat near a person who can't report a bite, such as a small child or a person with a disability, assume that person has been bitten",Rabies
"The virus is spread through the saliva of infected animals",Rabies
"Infected animals can spread the virus by biting another animal or a person",Rabies
"In rare cases, rabies can be spread when infected saliva gets into an open wound or the mucous membranes, such as the mouth or eyes",Rabies

"Returning to the diet may improve mental functioning and behavior and slow damage to the central nervous system in adults with high phenylalanine levels",Phenylketonuria
"Disproportionate dwarfism Most people with dwarfism have disorders that cause disproportionately short stature",Dwarfism
"Usually, this means that a person has an average-size trunk and very short limbs, but some people may have a very short trunk and shortened (but disproportionately large) limbs",Dwarfism
"In these disorders, the head is disproportionately large compared with the body",Dwarfism
"Almost all people with disproportionate dwarfism have normal intellectual capacities",Dwarfism
"Rare exceptions are usually the result of a secondary factor, such as excess fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus)",Dwarfism
"The most common cause of dwarfism is a disorder called achondroplasia, which causes disproportionately short stature",Dwarfism
"This disorder usually results in the following: An average-size trunk Short arms and legs, with particularly short upper arms and upper legs Short fingers, often with a wide separation between the middle and ring fingers Limited mobility at the elbows A disproportionately large head, with a prominent forehead and a flattened bridge of the nose Progressive development of bowed legs Progressive development of swayed lower back An adult height around 4 feet (122 cm) Another cause of disproportionate dwarfism is a rare disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC)",Dwarfism
"Signs may include: A very short trunk A short neck Shortened arms and legs Average-size hands and feet Broad, rounded chest Slightly flattened cheekbones Opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) Hip deformities that result in thighbones turning inward A foot that's twisted or out of shape Instability of the neck bones Progressive hunching curvature of the upper spine Progressive development of swayed lower back Vision and hearing problems Arthritis and problems with joint movement Adult height ranging from 3 feet (91 cm) to just over 4 feet (122 cm) Proportionate dwarfism Proportionate dwarfism results from medical conditions present at birth or appearing in early childhood that limit overall growth and development",Dwarfism
"So the head, trunk and limbs are all small, but they're proportionate to each other",Dwarfism
"Because these disorders affect overall growth, many of them result in poor development of one or more body systems",Dwarfism
"Growth hormone deficiency is a relatively common cause of proportionate dwarfism",Dwarfism
"It occurs when the pituitary gland fails to produce an adequate supply of growth hormone, which is essential for normal childhood growth",Dwarfism
"Proportionate dwarfism may not be immediately apparent",Dwarfism
"See your child's doctor if you have any concerns about your child's growth or overall development",Dwarfism

"Doctors often separate the types of myoclonus based on their causes, which helps determine treatment",Myoclonus
"Types of myoclonus include the following categories",Myoclonus
"Physiological myoclonus This type of myoclonus occurs in normal, healthy people and rarely needs treatment",Myoclonus
"Examples include: Hiccups Sleep starts Shakes or spasms due to anxiety or exercise Infant muscle twitching during sleep or after a feeding Essential myoclonus Essential myoclonus occurs on its own, usually without other symptoms and without being related to any underlying illness",Myoclonus
"The cause of essential myoclonus is often unexplained (idiopathic) or, in some cases, hereditary",Myoclonus
"Epileptic myoclonus This type of myoclonus occurs as part of an epileptic disorder",Myoclonus
"Symptomatic (secondary) myoclonus Muscle jerks that occur as a result of an underlying medical condition, including: Head or spinal cord injury Infection Kidney or liver failure Lipid storage disease Chemical or drug poisoning Prolonged oxygen deprivation Medication reaction Autoimmune inflammatory conditions Metabolic disorders Nervous system conditions that result in secondary myoclonus include:",Myoclonus
"In fact, severe high blood pressure may not cause symptoms",Prehypertension
"The only way to detect prehypertension is to keep track of your blood pressure readings",Prehypertension
"Have your blood pressure checked at each doctor's visit — or check it yourself at home with a home blood pressure monitoring device",Prehypertension
"You may need more-frequent readings if you have prehypertension or other risk factors for cardiovascular disease",Prehypertension
"You can have few symptoms or several, and symptoms can change during the course of the disease",Rheumatic fever
"The onset of rheumatic fever usually occurs about two to four weeks after a strep throat infection",Rheumatic fever
"Rheumatic fever signs and symptoms — which result from inflammation in the heart, joints, skin or central nervous system — can include: Fever Painful and tender joints — most often in the knees, ankles, elbows and wrists Pain in one joint that migrates to another joint Red, hot or swollen joints Small, painless bumps (nodules) beneath the skin Chest pain Heart murmur Fatigue Flat or slightly raised, painless rash with a ragged edge (erythema marginatum) Jerky, uncontrollable body movements (Sydenham chorea, or St",Rheumatic fever
"Proper treatment of strep can prevent rheumatic fever",Rheumatic fever
"Also, have your child see a doctor if he or she shows other indications of rheumatic fever",Rheumatic fever
"Group A streptococcus infections of the throat cause strep throat or, less commonly, scarlet fever",Rheumatic fever
"Group A streptococcus infections of the skin or other parts of the body rarely trigger rheumatic fever",Rheumatic fever
"The link between strep infection and rheumatic fever isn't clear, but it appears that the bacterium tricks the immune system",Rheumatic fever
"The strep bacterium contains a protein similar to one found in certain tissues of the body",Rheumatic fever
"So immune system cells that would normally target the bacterium may treat the body's own tissues as if they were infectious agents — particularly tissues of the heart, joints, skin and central nervous system",Rheumatic fever
"This immune system reaction results in inflammation",Rheumatic fever
"If your child receives prompt treatment with an antibiotic to eliminate strep bacteria and takes all medication as prescribed, there's little chance of developing rheumatic fever",Rheumatic fever
"If your child has one or more episodes of strep throat or scarlet fever that aren't treated or not treated completely, he or she might develop rheumatic fever",Rheumatic fever
"Some people carry a gene or genes that might make them more likely to develop rheumatic fever",Rheumatic fever
"Type of strep bacteria",Rheumatic fever
"Certain strains of strep bacteria are more likely to contribute to rheumatic fever than are other strains",Rheumatic fever
"Environmental factors",Rheumatic fever
"A greater risk of rheumatic fever is associated with overcrowding, poor sanitation and other conditions that can easily result in the rapid transmission or multiple exposures to strep bacteria",Rheumatic fever
"In some cases, the inflammation causes long-term complications",Rheumatic fever
"Rheumatic heart disease is permanent damage to the heart caused by rheumatic fever",Rheumatic fever
"It usually occurs 10 to 20 years after the original illness",Rheumatic fever
"Problems are most common with the valve between the two left chambers of the heart (mitral valve), but the other valves can be affected",Rheumatic fever
"The damage can result in: Valve stenosis",Rheumatic fever
"This narrowing of the valve decreases blood flow",Rheumatic fever
"Valve regurgitation",Rheumatic fever
"This leak in the valve allows blood to flow in the wrong direction",Rheumatic fever
"Damage to heart muscle",Rheumatic fever
"The inflammation associated with rheumatic fever can weaken the heart muscle, affecting its ability to pump",Rheumatic fever
"Damage to the mitral valve, other heart valves or other heart tissues can cause problems with the heart later in life",Rheumatic fever
"Resulting conditions can include:",Rheumatic fever
"The two main types of priapism are ischemic and nonischemic priapism",Priapism NOS
"Ischemic priapism Ischemic priapism, also called low-flow priapism, is the result of blood not being able to leave the penis",Priapism NOS
"It's the more common type of priapism",Priapism NOS
"Signs and symptoms include: Erection lasting more than four hours or unrelated to sexual interest or stimulation Rigid penile shaft, but the tip of penis (glans) is soft Progressive penile pain Recurrent or stuttering priapism, a form of ischemic priapism, is an uncommon condition",Priapism NOS
"It's more common in males who have an inherited disorder characterized by abnormally shaped red blood cells (sickle cell anemia)",Priapism NOS
"Sickle cells can block the blood vessels in the penis",Priapism NOS
"Recurrent priapism describes repetitive episodes of prolonged erections and often includes episodes of ischemic priapism",Priapism NOS
"In some cases, the condition starts off with unwanted and painful erections of short duration and might progress over time to more frequent and more prolonged erections",Priapism NOS
"Nonischemic priapism Nonischemic priapism, also known as high-flow priapism, occurs when penile blood flow isn't regulated appropriately",Priapism NOS
"Nonischemic priapism is usually painless",Priapism NOS
"The emergency room doctor will determine whether you have ischemic priapism or nonischemic priapism",Priapism NOS
"This is necessary because the treatment for each is different, and treatment for ischemic priapism needs to be done as soon as possible",Priapism NOS
"If you experience recurrent, persistent, painful erections that resolve on their own, see your doctor",Priapism NOS
"You might need treatment to prevent further episodes",Priapism NOS
"This stimulation causes certain blood vessels and smooth muscles to relax and/or expand, increasing blood flow to spongy tissues in the penis",Priapism NOS
"Consequently, the blood-filled penis becomes erect",Priapism NOS
"After stimulation ends, the blood flows out and the penis returns to its nonrigid (flaccid) state",Priapism NOS
"Priapism occurs when some part of this system — the blood, blood vessels, smooth muscles or nerves — changes normal blood flow",Priapism NOS
"Subsequently, the erection persists",Priapism NOS
"While the underlying cause of priapism often can't be determined, several conditions are believed to play a role",Priapism NOS
"Blood disorders Blood-related diseases might contribute to priapism — usually ischemic priapism, when blood isn't able to flow out of the penis",Priapism NOS
"These disorders include: Sickle cell anemia Leukemia Other hematologic dyscrasias, such as thalassemia, multiple myeloma and others The most common associated diagnosis in children is sickle cell anemia",Priapism NOS
"Prescription medications Priapism, usually ischemic priapism, is a possible side effect of a number of drugs, including: Medications injected directly into the penis to treat erectile dysfunction, such as alprostadil, papaverine, phentolamine and others Antidepressants, such as fluoxetine (Prozac), bupropion (Wellbutrin), and sertraline Alpha blockers including prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin and tamsulosin Medications used to treat anxiety or psychotic disorders, such as hydroxyzine, risperidone (Risperdal), olanzapine (Zyprexa), lithium, clozapine, chlorpromazine and thioridazine Blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin) and heparin Hormones such as testosterone or gonadotropin-releasing hormone Medications used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ), such as atomoxetine (Strattera) Alcohol and drug use Alcohol, marijuana, cocaine and other illicit drug abuse can cause priapism, particularly ischemic priapism",Priapism NOS
"Injury A common cause of nonischemic priapism — a persistent erection caused by excessive blood flow into the penis — is trauma or injury to your penis, pelvis or perineum, the region between the base of the penis and the anus",Priapism NOS
"The blood trapped in the penis is deprived of oxygen",Priapism NOS
"When an erection lasts for too long, this oxygen-poor blood can begin to damage or destroy tissues in the penis",Priapism NOS
"As a result, untreated priapism can cause erectile dysfunction",Priapism NOS
"If your blood sugar is very high, you might have signs and symptoms of diabetes — including increased thirst and urination, fatigue, and blurred vision",Metabolic syndrome
"It's also linked to a condition called insulin resistance",Metabolic syndrome
"Normally, your digestive system breaks down the foods you eat into sugar (glucose)",Metabolic syndrome
"Insulin is a hormone made by your pancreas that helps sugar enter your cells to be used as fuel",Metabolic syndrome
"In people with insulin resistance, cells don't respond normally to insulin, and glucose can't enter the cells as easily",Metabolic syndrome
"As a result, glucose levels in your blood rise despite your body's attempt to control the glucose by churning out more and more insulin",Metabolic syndrome
"Your risk of metabolic syndrome increases with age",Metabolic syndrome
"Race",Metabolic syndrome
"In the United States, Mexican-Americans appear to be at the greatest risk of developing metabolic syndrome",Metabolic syndrome
"Obesity",Metabolic syndrome
"Carrying too much weight, especially in your abdomen, increases your risk of metabolic syndrome",Metabolic syndrome
"Diabetes",Metabolic syndrome
"You're more likely to have metabolic syndrome if you had diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) or if you have a family history of type 2 diabetes",Metabolic syndrome
"Other diseases",Metabolic syndrome
"Your risk of metabolic syndrome is higher if you've ever had cardiovascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or polycystic ovary syndrome",Metabolic syndrome
"Signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis include: Pain",Osteoarthritis
"Your joint may hurt during or after movement",Osteoarthritis

"Loss of flexibility",Osteoarthritis
"You may not be able to move your joint through its full range of motion",Osteoarthritis
"Grating sensation",Osteoarthritis
"You may hear or feel a grating sensation when you use the joint",Osteoarthritis
"Bone spurs",Osteoarthritis
"These extra bits of bone, which feel like hard lumps, may form around the affected joint",Osteoarthritis
"Cartilage is a firm, slippery tissue that permits nearly frictionless joint motion",Osteoarthritis
"In osteoarthritis, the slick surface of the cartilage becomes rough",Osteoarthritis
"Eventually, if the cartilage wears down completely, you may be left with bone rubbing on bone",Osteoarthritis
"The risk of osteoarthritis increases with age",Osteoarthritis
"Sex",Osteoarthritis
"Women are more likely to develop osteoarthritis, though it isn't clear why",Osteoarthritis
"Carrying extra body weight contributes to osteoarthritis in several ways, and the more you weigh, the greater your risk",Osteoarthritis
"Increased weight puts added stress on weight-bearing joints, such as your hips and knees",Osteoarthritis
"In addition, fat tissue produces proteins that may cause harmful inflammation in and around your joints",Osteoarthritis
"Joint injuries",Osteoarthritis
"Injuries, such as those that occur when playing sports or from an accident, may increase the risk of osteoarthritis",Osteoarthritis
"Even injuries that occurred many years ago and seemingly healed can increase your risk of osteoarthritis",Osteoarthritis
"Certain occupations",Osteoarthritis
"If your job includes tasks that place repetitive stress on a particular joint, that joint may eventually develop osteoarthritis",Osteoarthritis
"Genetics",Osteoarthritis
"Some people inherit a tendency to develop osteoarthritis",Osteoarthritis
"Some people are born with malformed joints or defective cartilage, which can increase the risk of osteoarthritis",Osteoarthritis
"Joint pain and stiffness may become severe enough to make daily tasks difficult",Osteoarthritis
"Some people are no longer able to work",Osteoarthritis
"When joint pain is this severe, doctors may suggest joint replacement surgery",Osteoarthritis
"Kidney stones that form in children and teenagers are likely to be caused by an underlying condition, such as hyperoxaluria",Hyperoxaluria
"All young people with kidney stones should see a doctor for a thorough evaluation, including a test that measures oxalate in the urine",Hyperoxaluria
"Adults with recurrent kidney stones also should be evaluated for oxalate in the urine",Hyperoxaluria
"There are several types of hyperoxaluria: Primary hyperoxaluria",Hyperoxaluria
"Primary hyperoxaluria is a rare inherited (genetic) condition present at birth",Hyperoxaluria
"In this type, the liver doesn't create enough of a certain protein (enzyme) that prevents overproduction of oxalate, or the enzyme doesn't work properly",Hyperoxaluria
"Excess oxalate is eliminated through your kidneys, in your urine",Hyperoxaluria
"The extra oxalate can combine with calcium to create kidney stones and crystals, which can damage the kidneys and cause them to stop working (renal failure)",Hyperoxaluria
"Kidney stones form early and most often cause symptoms during childhood or adolescence",Hyperoxaluria
"Because of the very large amounts of oxalate produced, the kidneys of many people with primary hyperoxaluria fail by early to middle adulthood",Hyperoxaluria
"But renal failure can occur as early as infancy, while others with primary hyperoxaluria never develop kidney failure",Hyperoxaluria
"To date, experts have identified three different genetic causes of primary hyperoxaluria",Hyperoxaluria
"Oxalosis",Hyperoxaluria
"Oxalosis occurs if you have primary hyperoxaluria and your kidneys fail",Hyperoxaluria
"Because your body can no longer eliminate the extra oxalate, it starts accumulating — first in your blood, then in your eyes, bones, skin, muscles, blood vessels, heart and other organs",Hyperoxaluria
"This can cause multiple problems",Hyperoxaluria
"Enteric hyperoxaluria",Hyperoxaluria
"Several intestinal diseases, including Crohn's disease and short bowel syndrome as a result of surgical procedures, increase the absorption of oxalate from foods, which can then increase the amount of oxalate excreted in the urine",Hyperoxaluria
"Hyperoxaluria related to eating high-oxalate foods",Hyperoxaluria
"Eating large amounts of foods high in oxalate can increase your risk of hyperoxaluria or kidney stones",Hyperoxaluria
"Ask your doctor or dietitian for a list of high-oxalate foods",Hyperoxaluria
"Avoiding high-oxalate foods is particularly important if you have enteric hyperoxaluria",Hyperoxaluria
"Over time your kidneys may stop working",Hyperoxaluria
"For some people, this is the first sign of the disease",Hyperoxaluria
"Signs and symptoms of kidney failure include: Decreased urine output or no urine output at all Feeling generally ill and tired Loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting Pale skin color related to anemia Swelling of hands and feet Oxalosis in its late stages can cause a variety of complications outside the kidney, including bone disease, anemia, skin ulcers, heart and eye problems, and in children, a failure to develop and grow normally",Hyperoxaluria
"You might not know you have a polyp until your doctor finds it during an examination of your bowel",Colon polyps
"But some people with colon polyps experience: Rectal bleeding",Colon polyps
"This can be a sign of colon polyps or cancer or other conditions, such as hemorrhoids or minor tears in your anus",Colon polyps
"Change in stool color",Colon polyps
"Blood can show up as red streaks in your stool or make stool appear black",Colon polyps
"A change in color may also be caused by foods, medications and supplements",Colon polyps
"Change in bowel habits",Colon polyps
"Constipation or diarrhea that lasts longer than a week may indicate the presence of a large colon polyp",Colon polyps
"But a number of other conditions can also cause changes in bowel habits",Colon polyps
"Pain, nausea or vomiting",Colon polyps
"A large colon polyp can partially obstruct your bowel, leading to crampy abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting",Colon polyps
"Iron deficiency anemia",Colon polyps
"Bleeding from polyps can occur slowly over time, without visible blood in your stool",Colon polyps
"Chronic bleeding robs your body of the iron needed to produce the substance that allows red blood cells to carry oxygen to your body (hemoglobin)",Colon polyps
"The result is iron deficiency anemia, which can make you feel tired and short of breath",Colon polyps
"You have risk factors, such as a family history of colon cancer",Colon polyps
"Some high-risk individuals should begin regular screening much earlier than age 50",Colon polyps
"Excessive thoughts, feelings and behaviors can include: Having a high level of worry about potential illness Considering normal physical sensations as a sign of severe physical illness Fearing the medical seriousness of symptoms, even when there is no evidence to support that concern Appraising physical sensations as threatening, harmful or causing problems Feeling that medical evaluation and treatment have not been adequate Fearing that physical activity may cause damage to your body Repeatedly checking your body for abnormalities Frequent health care visits that don't relieve your concerns or that make them worse Being unresponsive to medical treatment or unusually sensitive to medication side effects Having a more severe impairment than would usually be expected related to a medical condition For somatic symptom disorder, more important than the specific physical symptoms you experience is the way you interpret and react to the symptoms and how they impact your daily life",Somatic symptom disorder
"Because symptoms can be related to health problems, it's important to be evaluated by your health care provider if you aren't sure what's causing your symptoms",Somatic symptom disorder
"If your provider believes that you may have somatic symptom disorder, he or she may also refer you to a mental health provider",Somatic symptom disorder
"Caring for a loved one When physical symptoms considered to be somatic symptom disorder occur, it can be difficult to accept that a life-threatening illness has been eliminated as the cause",Somatic symptom disorder
"Encourage your loved one to consider the possibility of a mental health referral to learn ways to cope with the reaction to symptoms and any disability it causes",Somatic symptom disorder
"Physical disability may cause the person to be dependent and need extra physical care and emotional support that can exhaust caregivers and cause stress on families and relationships",Somatic symptom disorder
"If you feel overwhelmed by your role as caregiver, you may want to talk to a mental health professional to address your own needs",Somatic symptom disorder
"The joint could be swollen, red and warm, and you might have a fever",Septic arthritis
"Prompt treatment can help minimize joint damage",Septic arthritis
"Bacterial infection with Staphylococcus aureus (staph) is the most common cause",Septic arthritis
"Staph commonly lives on even healthy skin",Septic arthritis
"Septic arthritis can develop when an infection, such as a skin infection or urinary tract infection, spreads through your bloodstream to a joint",Septic arthritis
"Less commonly, a puncture wound, drug injection, or surgery in or near a joint can give the germs entry into the joint space",Septic arthritis
"The lining of your joints (synovium) has little ability to protect itself from infection",Septic arthritis
"Your body's reaction to the infection — including inflammation that can increase pressure and reduce blood flow within the joint — contributes to the damage",Septic arthritis
"Chronic diseases and conditions that affect your joints — such as osteoarthritis, gout, rheumatoid arthritis or lupus — can increase your risk of septic arthritis, as can an artificial joint, previous joint surgery and joint injury",Septic arthritis
"Taking medications for rheumatoid arthritis",Septic arthritis
"People with rheumatoid arthritis have a further increase in risk because of medications they take that can suppress the immune system, making infections more likely to occur",Septic arthritis
"Diagnosing septic arthritis in people with rheumatoid arthritis is difficult because many of the signs and symptoms are similar",Septic arthritis
"Skin fragility",Septic arthritis
"Skin that breaks easily and heals poorly can give bacteria access to your body",Septic arthritis
"Skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema increase your risk of septic arthritis, as do infected skin wounds",Septic arthritis
"People who regularly inject drugs also have a higher risk of infection at the site of injection",Septic arthritis
"Weak immune system",Septic arthritis
"People with a weak immune system are at greater risk of septic arthritis",Septic arthritis
"This includes people with diabetes, kidney and liver problems, and those taking drugs that suppress their immune systems",Septic arthritis
"Joint trauma",Septic arthritis
"Animal bites, puncture woods or cuts over a joint can put you at risk of septic arthritis",Septic arthritis
"Having a combination of risk factors puts you at greater risk than having just one risk factor does",Septic arthritis

"In general, cancerous spinal tumors grow more quickly, and noncancerous spinal tumors tend to develop very slowly",Vertebral tumor
"Most back pain isn't caused by a tumor",Vertebral tumor
"Experts suspect that defective genes play a role",Vertebral tumor
"But it's usually not known whether such genetic defects are inherited, occur spontaneously or are caused by something in the environment, such as exposure to certain chemicals",Vertebral tumor
"Most vertebral tumors are caused by other cancerous tumors that have spread from elsewhere in the body",Vertebral tumor
"Any type of cancer can travel to the spine, but cancers of nearby organs such as the breast, lung and prostate are more likely than others to spread to the spine as well as cancers of the bone such as multiple myeloma",Vertebral tumor
"Vertebral tumors also are more common in people who have a prior history of cancer",Vertebral tumor
"Nerve damage may be permanent",Vertebral tumor
"A vertebral tumor may also damage the spine and make it unstable, which raises the risk of a sudden fracture or collapse of the spine that could injure the spinal cord",Vertebral tumor
"However, if caught early and treated aggressively, it may be possible to regain nerve function",Vertebral tumor
"Depending on its location, a tumor that impinges on the spinal cord itself may be life-threatening",Vertebral tumor
"A person with aphasia may: Speak in short or incomplete sentences Speak in sentences that don't make sense Substitute one word for another or one sound for another Speak unrecognizable words Not understand other people's conversation Write sentences that don't make sense The severity and scope of the problems depend on the extent of damage and the area of the brain affected",Aphasia NOS
"Types of aphasia Your doctor may refer to aphasia as nonfluent, fluent or global: Nonfluent aphasia",Aphasia NOS
"Damage to the language network near the left frontal area of the brain usually results in Broca aphasia, which is also called nonfluent aphasia",Aphasia NOS
"People with this disorder struggle to get words out, speak in very short sentences and omit words",Aphasia NOS

"They're often aware of their difficulty communicating and may get frustrated",Aphasia NOS
"People with Broca aphasia may also have right-sided paralysis or weakness",Aphasia NOS
"Fluent aphasia",Aphasia NOS
"People with this form of aphasia may speak easily and fluently in long, complex sentences that don't make sense or include unrecognizable, incorrect or unnecessary words",Aphasia NOS

"The stolen items are usually stashed away, never to be used",Kleptomania
"Items may also be donated, given away to family or friends, or even secretly returned to the place from which they were stolen",Kleptomania
"Urges to steal may come and go or may occur with greater or lesser intensity over the course of time",Kleptomania
"Many people who may have kleptomania don't want to seek treatment because they're afraid they'll be arrested or jailed",Kleptomania
"However, a mental health provider typically doesn't report your thefts to authorities",Kleptomania
"Some people seek medical help because they're afraid they'll get caught and have legal consequences",Kleptomania
"Or they've already been arrested, and they're legally required to seek treatment",Kleptomania
"Getting treatment may help you gain control over your kleptomania",Kleptomania
"If a loved one has kleptomania If you suspect a close friend or family member may have kleptomania, gently raise your concerns with your loved one",Kleptomania

"If you develop any symptoms that may suggest aortic valve disease, see your doctor",Aortic valve disease
"These valves include the mitral valve, tricuspid valve, pulmonary valve and aortic valve",Aortic valve disease
"Each valve has flaps (cusps or leaflets) that open and close once during each heartbeat",Aortic valve disease
"Sometimes, the valves don't open or close properly, disrupting the blood flow through your heart and potentially impairing the ability to pump blood to your body",Aortic valve disease
"In aortic valve disease, the aortic valve between the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle) and the main artery that delivers blood from the heart to the body (aorta) doesn't work properly",Aortic valve disease
"It may not be closing properly, which causes blood to leak backward to the left ventricle (regurgitation), or the valve may be narrowed (stenosis)",Aortic valve disease
"Aortic valve disease may be caused by a heart defect present at birth (congenital)",Aortic valve disease
"It can also be caused by other conditions, including age-related changes to the heart, infections, high blood pressure or injury to the heart",Aortic valve disease

"Every minute counts",Stroke
"The longer a stroke goes untreated, the greater the potential for brain damage and disability",Stroke
"If you're with someone you suspect is having a stroke, watch the person carefully while waiting for emergency assistance",Stroke
"This deprives your brain of oxygen and nutrients, which can cause your brain cells to die",Stroke
"A stroke may be caused by a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or the leaking or bursting of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke)",Stroke
"Some people may experience only a temporary disruption of blood flow to their brain (transient ischemic attack, or TIA)",Stroke
"Ischemic stroke About 85 percent of strokes are ischemic strokes",Stroke
"Ischemic strokes occur when the arteries to your brain become narrowed or blocked, causing severely reduced blood flow (ischemia)",Stroke
"The most common ischemic strokes include: Thrombotic stroke",Stroke
"A thrombotic stroke occurs when a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one of the arteries that supply blood to your brain",Stroke
"A clot may be caused by fatty deposits (plaque) that build up in arteries and cause reduced blood flow (atherosclerosis) or other artery conditions",Stroke
"Embolic stroke",Stroke
"An embolic stroke occurs when a blood clot or other debris forms away from your brain — commonly in your heart — and is swept through your bloodstream to lodge in narrower brain arteries",Stroke
"This type of blood clot is called an embolus",Stroke
"Hemorrhagic stroke Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in your brain leaks or ruptures",Stroke
"Brain hemorrhages can result from many conditions that affect your blood vessels, including uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension), overtreatment with anticoagulants and weak spots in your blood vessel walls (aneurysms)",Stroke
"A less common cause of hemorrhage is the rupture of an abnormal tangle of thin-walled blood vessels (arteriovenous malformation) present at birth",Stroke
"Types of hemorrhagic stroke include: Intracerebral hemorrhage",Stroke
"In an intracerebral hemorrhage, a blood vessel in the brain bursts and spills into the surrounding brain tissue, damaging brain cells",Stroke
"Brain cells beyond the leak are deprived of blood and also damaged",Stroke
"High blood pressure, trauma, vascular malformations, use of blood-thinning medications and other conditions may cause an intracerebral hemorrhage",Stroke
"Subarachnoid hemorrhage",Stroke
"In a subarachnoid hemorrhage, an artery on or near the surface of your brain bursts and spills into the space between the surface of your brain and your skull",Stroke
"This bleeding is often signaled by a sudden, severe headache",Stroke
"A subarachnoid hemorrhage is commonly caused by the bursting of a small sack-shaped or berry-shaped outpouching on an artery known as an aneurysm",Stroke
"After the hemorrhage, the blood vessels in your brain may widen and narrow erratically (vasospasm), causing brain cell damage by further limiting blood flow",Stroke
"Ischemic stroke Ischemic stroke Transient ischemic attack (TIA) A transient ischemic attack (TIA) — also known as a ministroke — is a brief period of symptoms similar to those you'd have in a stroke",Stroke
"A temporary decrease in blood supply to part of your brain causes TIAs, which often last less than five minutes",Stroke
"Like an ischemic stroke, a TIA occurs when a clot or debris blocks blood flow to part of your brain",Stroke
"A TIA doesn't leave lasting symptoms because the blockage is temporary",Stroke
"Seek emergency care even if your symptoms seem to clear up",Stroke
"Having a TIA puts you at greater risk of having a full-blown stroke, causing permanent damage later",Stroke
"If you've had a TIA, it means there's likely a partially blocked or narrowed artery leading to your brain or a clot source in the heart",Stroke
"It's not possible to tell if you're having a stroke or a TIA based only on your symptoms",Stroke
"Up to half of people whose symptoms appear to go away actually have had a stroke causing brain damage",Stroke
"Some factors can also increase your chances of having a heart attack",Stroke
"Potentially treatable stroke risk factors include: Lifestyle risk factors Being overweight or obese Physical inactivity Heavy or binge drinking Use of illicit drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamines Medical risk factors High blood pressure — the risk of stroke begins to increase at blood pressure readings higher than 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg)",Stroke

"Others may have difficulty thinking, making judgments, reasoning and understanding concepts",Stroke
"Emotional problems",Stroke
"People who have had strokes may have more difficulty controlling their emotions, or they may develop depression",Stroke
"Pain",Stroke
"People who have had strokes may have pain, numbness or other strange sensations in parts of their bodies affected by stroke",Stroke
"For example, if a stroke causes you to lose feeling in your left arm, you may develop an uncomfortable tingling sensation in that arm",Stroke
"People also may be sensitive to temperature changes, especially extreme cold after a stroke",Stroke
"This complication is known as central stroke pain or central pain syndrome",Stroke
"This condition generally develops several weeks after a stroke, and it may improve over time",Stroke
"But because the pain is caused by a problem in your brain, rather than a physical injury, there are few treatments",Stroke
"Changes in behavior and self-care ability",Stroke
"People who have had strokes may become more withdrawn and less social or more impulsive",Stroke
"They may need help with grooming and daily chores",Stroke

"Parvovirus symptoms in children Early signs and symptoms of parvovirus infection in children may include: Fever Upset stomach Headache Runny nose Distinctive facial rash Several days after the appearance of early symptoms, a distinctive bright red facial rash may appear — usually on both cheeks",Parvovirus infection
"Eventually it may extend to the arms, trunk, thighs and buttocks, where the rash has a pink, lacy, slightly raised appearance",Parvovirus infection
"The rash may be itchy, especially on the soles of the feet",Parvovirus infection
"Generally, the rash occurs near the end of the illness",Parvovirus infection
"It's possible to mistake the rash for other viral rashes or a medicine-related rash",Parvovirus infection
"The rash may come and go for up to three weeks, becoming more visible when a child is exposed to extreme temperatures or spends time in the sun",Parvovirus infection
"Parvovirus symptoms in adults Adults don't usually develop the slapped-cheek rash",Parvovirus infection
"Instead, the most prominent symptom of parvovirus infection in adults is joint soreness, lasting days to weeks",Parvovirus infection

"Stage 1 In the first stage, you're likely to feel unwell with: Fatigue Unintended weight loss General aches and pains Mild fever Not everyone has these early signs and symptoms",Takayasu's arteritis
"It's possible for inflammation to damage arteries for years before you realize something is wrong",Takayasu's arteritis
"Stage 2 During the second stage, inflammation is causing arteries to narrow so less blood, oxygen and nutrients reach your organs and tissues",Takayasu's arteritis
"Make an appointment with your doctor if you have other signs or symptoms that worry you",Takayasu's arteritis
"Early detection of Takayasu's arteritis is key to getting effective treatment",Takayasu's arteritis
"If you've already been diagnosed with Takayasu's arteritis, keep in mind that the symptoms of a disease flare (recurrence) are often similar to those that occurred originally",Takayasu's arteritis
"Also pay attention to any new signs or symptoms",Takayasu's arteritis
"These may indicate either a recurrence or a complication of treatment",Takayasu's arteritis
"Over time the inflammation causes changes in these arteries, including thickening, narrowing and scarring",Takayasu's arteritis
"No one knows exactly what causes the initial inflammation in Takayasu's arteritis",Takayasu's arteritis
"It's likely that the condition is an autoimmune disease in which your immune system attacks your own arteries by mistake",Takayasu's arteritis
"The disease may be triggered by a virus or other infection",Takayasu's arteritis
"The disorder occurs worldwide, but it's most common in Asia",Takayasu's arteritis
"Sometimes the condition runs in families",Takayasu's arteritis
"But the disease and drugs used to treat it can affect your fertility and pregnancy",Takayasu's arteritis
"If you have Takayasu's arteritis and are planning on becoming pregnant, work with your doctor to develop a plan to limit complications of pregnancy before you conceive",Takayasu's arteritis
"And during your pregnancy see your doctor regularly for checkups",Takayasu's arteritis
"But in some cases, the cause is known",Liver cancer
"For instance, chronic infection with certain hepatitis viruses can cause liver cancer",Liver cancer
"Liver cancer occurs when liver cells develop changes (mutations) in their DNA — the material that provides instructions for every chemical process in your body",Liver cancer

"One result is that cells may begin to grow out of control and eventually form a tumor — a mass of cancerous cells",Liver cancer
"You might be aware of your condition only from results of an electrocardiogram (ECG) done for an unrelated reason, because you have a family history of long QT syndrome or because of genetic testing results",Long QT syndrome
"For people who do experience signs and symptoms of long QT syndrome, the most common long QT symptoms include: Fainting",Long QT syndrome
"This is the most common sign of long QT syndrome",Long QT syndrome
"Long QT syndrome-triggered fainting spells (syncope) are caused by the heart temporarily beating in an erratic way",Long QT syndrome
"These fainting spells might happen when you're excited, angry, scared or during exercise",Long QT syndrome
"Fainting can occur without warning, such as losing consciousness after being startled by a ringing telephone",Long QT syndrome
"Unlike normal fainting spells that are preceded by warning signs such as lightheadedness, heart palpitations, irregular heartbeat, weakness and blurred vision, long QT syndrome-triggered fainting spells can occur with little to no warning",Long QT syndrome
"Seizures",Long QT syndrome
"If the heart continues to beat erratically, the brain becomes increasingly deprived of oxygen, which can cause seizures",Long QT syndrome
"Sudden death",Long QT syndrome
"Generally, the heart returns to its normal rhythm",Long QT syndrome
"If this doesn't happen spontaneously and paramedics don't arrive in time to convert the rhythm back to normal with an external defibrillator, sudden death will occur",Long QT syndrome
"Signs and symptoms of inherited long QT syndrome might start during the first weeks to months after birth, or as late as older age, or never at all",Long QT syndrome
"Most people who experience signs or symptoms from long QT syndrome have their first episode by age 40",Long QT syndrome
"Signs and symptoms of long QT syndrome might occur during sleep or arousal from sleep",Long QT syndrome
"Because long QT syndrome can occur in families, ask your doctor to be tested for long QT syndrome if a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has been diagnosed with long QT syndrome",Long QT syndrome
"Hunter syndrome symptoms vary and range from mild to severe",Hunter syndrome
"He or she can help you decide if you need to see a specialist or seek further testing",Hunter syndrome
"Because of that defective chromosome, an enzyme that's needed to break down complex sugar molecules is missing or malfunctioning",Hunter syndrome
"Without this enzyme, massive amounts of these complex sugar molecules collect in the cells, blood and connective tissues, causing permanent and progressive damage",Hunter syndrome
"Hunter syndrome is caused by a defective chromosome, and a child must inherit the defective chromosome to develop the disease",Hunter syndrome
"Hunter syndrome is what's known as an X-linked recessive disease",Hunter syndrome
"This means that women carry the defective disease-causing X chromosome and can pass it on, but women aren't affected by the disease themselves",Hunter syndrome
"Hunter syndrome nearly always occurs in males",Hunter syndrome
"Girls are far less at risk of developing this disease because they inherit two X chromosomes",Hunter syndrome
"If one of the X chromosomes is defective, their normal X chromosome can provide a functioning gene",Hunter syndrome
"If the X chromosome of a male is defective, however, there isn't another normal X chromosome to compensate for the problem",Hunter syndrome
"Respiratory complications An enlarged tongue, thickened gums, and thickening of the nasal passages and windpipe (trachea) make breathing difficult",Hunter syndrome
"Children often have chronic ear and sinus infections, respiratory infections, and pneumonia",Hunter syndrome
"Sleep apnea, a condition in which breathing is intermittently interrupted during sleep, is often present because of airway constriction",Hunter syndrome
"Cardiac complications Thickening of heart tissue can cause improper closing of heart valves",Hunter syndrome
"As a result, the heart and other parts of the body don't receive blood efficiently",Hunter syndrome
"As the disease progresses, these conditions often become worse and typically result in heart failure",Hunter syndrome
"The thickening of tissue can also cause narrowing of the aorta (coarctation) and other blood vessels",Hunter syndrome
"This in turn can result in high blood pressure (hypertension) and narrowing of arteries in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension)",Hunter syndrome
"Skeletal and connective tissue complications The storage of undigested complex sugar molecules in connective tissues results in abnormalities in bones, joints and ligaments",Hunter syndrome
"This reduces your child's growth, causing pain and physical malformations and making it difficult for him or her to move",Hunter syndrome
"Joint stiffness is caused by swelling of joint connective tissues and abnormalities of cartilage and bones",Hunter syndrome
"If your child is in pain, he or she will likely move less, which can lead to more stiffness and pain",Hunter syndrome
"The group of abnormalities typically seen in the bones of people with Hunter syndrome is called dysostosis multiplex",Hunter syndrome
"Children with these abnormalities can develop irregularly shaped vertebrae and spines (kyphoscoliosis), ribs, arms, fingers, legs, and pelvises",Hunter syndrome
"Their skulls may press down on or fuse with their upper spines",Hunter syndrome
"These complications cause many people with Hunter syndrome to be abnormally short",Hunter syndrome
"Those with milder cases may reach normal or near-normal height",Hunter syndrome
"Hernias (inguinal and umbilical) are common in Hunter syndrome",Hunter syndrome
"A hernia occurs when soft tissue, usually part of the intestine, pokes through a weak spot or tear in the lower abdominal wall",Hunter syndrome
"Hernias associated with Hunter syndrome can become quite large and are often one of the first signs of the disorder",Hunter syndrome
"Enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) may increase pressure in the abdomen, causing a hernia",Hunter syndrome
"Brain and nervous system complications A variety of neurological complications may be present and continue to develop in children with Hunter syndrome",Hunter syndrome
"Many neurological problems are caused by buildup of excess fluids in your child's brain (hydrocephalus)",Hunter syndrome
"Pressure from these fluids can cause other problems that may affect your child's eyes, ears and other sensory organs, which can cause severe headaches, interfere with vision or hearing and change your child's mental state",Hunter syndrome
"Your child also may develop a condition in which the membranes that surround the spinal cord may become thick and scarred (hypertrophic cervical pachymeningitis)",Hunter syndrome
"This causes pressure and compression of the upper spinal cord",Hunter syndrome
"As a result, your child may develop fatigue in his or her legs and gradually weaken and become less physically active",Hunter syndrome
"Other disorders, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, can result from nerve compression that happens because of bone deformities and storage of complex sugar molecules in tissues",Hunter syndrome
"Abnormal behavior can develop in children with more-severe cases of Hunter syndrome",Hunter syndrome
"Often your child's mental development will become affected between the ages of 2 and 6",Hunter syndrome
"Some children are hyperactive and have trouble paying attention or following directions",Hunter syndrome
"Your child may also behave aggressively and seem unable to sense danger",Hunter syndrome
"As your child's overall physical functioning declines, these behavior problems tend to become less severe",Hunter syndrome
"Seizures also may occur in children with Hunter syndrome",Hunter syndrome
"Longer recovery from other illnesses Recovery times from normal childhood illnesses may be longer for children with Hunter syndrome",Hunter syndrome
"As a result, be sure to take general preventive measures — for example, get your child a flu shot and ensure your child receives all necessary vaccinations",Hunter syndrome
"Personality disorders are conditions in which people have traits that cause them to feel and behave in socially distressing ways, limiting their ability to function in relationships and other areas of their life, such as work or school",Narcissistic personality disorder

"You may insist on having the best of everything — for instance, the best car, athletic club or medical care",Narcissistic personality disorder
"At the same time, you have trouble handling anything that may be perceived as criticism",Narcissistic personality disorder
"You may have secret feelings of insecurity, shame, vulnerability and humiliation",Narcissistic personality disorder
"To feel better, you may react with rage or contempt and try to belittle the other person to make yourself appear superior",Narcissistic personality disorder
"Or you may feel depressed and moody because you fall short of perfection",Narcissistic personality disorder
"Many experts use the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, to diagnose mental conditions",Narcissistic personality disorder
"This manual is also used by insurance companies to reimburse for treatment",Narcissistic personality disorder
"DSM-5 criteria for narcissistic personality disorder include these features: Having an exaggerated sense of self-importance Expecting to be recognized as superior even without achievements that warrant it Exaggerating your achievements and talents Being preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate Believing that you are superior and can only be understood by or associate with equally special people Requiring constant admiration Having a sense of entitlement Expecting special favors and unquestioning compliance with your expectations Taking advantage of others to get what you want Having an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others Being envious of others and believing others envy you Behaving in an arrogant or haughty manner Although some features of narcissistic personality disorder may seem like having confidence, it's not the same",Narcissistic personality disorder
"Narcissistic personality disorder crosses the border of healthy confidence into thinking so highly of yourself that you put yourself on a pedestal and value yourself more than you value others",Narcissistic personality disorder
"People with narcissistic personality disorder are most likely to seek treatment when they develop symptoms of depression — often because of perceived criticisms or rejections",Narcissistic personality disorder
"If you recognize aspects of your personality that are common to narcissistic personality disorder or you're feeling overwhelmed by sadness, consider reaching out to a trusted doctor or mental health provider",Narcissistic personality disorder

"Adult primary lateral sclerosis The cause of adult primary lateral sclerosis is unknown",Primary lateral sclerosis
"In most cases, it's not an inherited disease, and it's not known why or how it begins",Primary lateral sclerosis
"Juvenile primary lateral sclerosis Juvenile primary lateral sclerosis is caused by mutations in a gene called ALS 2",Primary lateral sclerosis
"Although researchers don't understand how this gene causes the disease, they know that the ALS 2 gene is responsible for giving instructions for creating a protein called alsin, which is present in motor neuron cells",Primary lateral sclerosis
"When the instructions are changed in someone with juvenile PLS , the protein alsin becomes unstable and doesn't work properly, which in turn impairs normal muscle function",Primary lateral sclerosis
"Adults who get primary lateral sclerosis don't appear to have the same gene mutation",Primary lateral sclerosis
"Juvenile primary lateral sclerosis is an autosomal recessive disease, meaning that both parents have to be carriers of the gene to pass it to their child, even though they don't have the disease themselves",Primary lateral sclerosis
"Some people may be able to continue to walk, but others will eventually need to use wheelchairs or other assistive devices",Primary lateral sclerosis
"These hormones circulate in your bloodstream and help regulate your metabolism",Goiter
"They maintain the rate at which your body uses fats and carbohydrates, help control your body temperature, influence your heart rate, and help regulate the production of proteins",Goiter
"Your thyroid gland also produces calcitonin — a hormone that helps regulate the amount of calcium in your blood",Goiter
"Your pituitary gland and hypothalamus control the rate at which these hormones are produced and released",Goiter
"The process begins when the hypothalamus — an area at the base of your brain that acts as a thermostat for your whole system — signals your pituitary gland to make a hormone known as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)",Goiter
"Your pituitary gland — also located at the base of your brain — releases a certain amount of TSH, depending on how much thyroxine and T-3 are in your blood",Goiter
"Your thyroid gland, in turn, regulates its production of hormones based on the amount of TSH it receives from the pituitary gland",Goiter
"Having a goiter doesn't necessarily mean that your thyroid gland isn't working normally",Goiter
"Even when it's enlarged, your thyroid may produce normal amounts of hormones",Goiter
"It might also, however, produce too much or too little thyroxine and T-3",Goiter
"A number of factors can cause your thyroid gland to enlarge",Goiter
"Among the most common are: Iodine deficiency",Goiter
"Iodine, which is essential for the production of thyroid hormones, is found primarily in seawater and in the soil in coastal areas",Goiter
"In the developing world, people who live inland or at high elevations are often iodine deficient and can develop goiters when the thyroid enlarges in an effort to obtain more iodine",Goiter
"The initial iodine deficiency may be made even worse by a diet high in hormone-inhibiting foods, such as cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower",Goiter
"Although a lack of dietary iodine is the main cause of goiters in many parts of the world, this is not often the case in countries where iodine is routinely added to table salt and other foods",Goiter
"Graves' disease",Goiter
"A goiter can sometimes occur when your thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism)",Goiter
"In Graves' disease, antibodies produced by your immune system mistakenly attack your thyroid gland, causing it to produce excess thyroxine",Goiter
"This overstimulation causes the thyroid to swell",Goiter
"Hashimoto's disease",Goiter
"A goiter can also result from an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)",Goiter
"Like Graves' disease, Hashimoto's disease is an autoimmune disorder",Goiter
"But instead of causing your thyroid to produce too much hormone, Hashimoto's damages your thyroid so that it produces too little",Goiter
"Sensing a low hormone level, your pituitary gland produces more TSH to stimulate the thyroid, which then causes the gland to enlarge",Goiter
"Multinodular goiter",Goiter
"In this condition, several solid or fluid-filled lumps called nodules develop in both sides of your thyroid, resulting in overall enlargement of the gland",Goiter
"Solitary thyroid nodules",Goiter
"In this case, a single nodule develops in one part of your thyroid gland",Goiter
"Most nodules are noncancerous (benign) and don't lead to cancer",Goiter
"Thyroid cancer",Goiter
"Thyroid cancer is far less common than benign thyroid nodules",Goiter
"A biopsy of a thyroid nodule is very accurate in determining if it's cancerous",Goiter
"Pregnancy",Goiter
"A hormone produced during pregnancy, human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), may cause your thyroid gland to enlarge slightly",Goiter
"Inflammation",Goiter
"Thyroiditis is an inflammatory condition that can cause pain and swelling in the thyroid",Goiter
"It may also cause an over- or underproduction of thyroxine",Goiter
"They may be present at birth and occur at any time throughout life",Goiter
"Some common risk factors for goiters include: A lack of dietary iodine",Goiter
"People living in areas where iodine is in short supply and who don't have access to iodine supplements are at high risk of goiters",Goiter
"Being female",Goiter
"Because women are more prone to thyroid disorders, they're also more likely to develop goiters",Goiter
"Your age",Goiter
"Goiters are more common after age 40",Goiter
"Medical history ",Goiter
"A personal or family history of autoimmune disease increases your risk",Goiter
"Pregnancy and menopause",Goiter
"For reasons that aren't entirely clear, thyroid problems are more likely to occur during pregnancy and menopause",Goiter
"Certain medications",Goiter
"Some medical treatments, including the heart drug amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone, others) and the psychiatric drug lithium (Lithobid, others), increase your risk",Goiter
"Radiation exposure",Goiter
"Your risk increases if you've had radiation treatments to your neck or chest area or you've been exposed to radiation in a nuclear facility, test or accident",Goiter
"But large goiters can make it hard to breathe or swallow and can cause a cough and hoarseness",Goiter
"Goiters that result from other conditions, such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, can be associated with a number of symptoms, ranging from fatigue and weight gain to unintended weight loss, irritability and trouble sleeping",Goiter
"Spina bifida occulta This mildest form results in a small separation or gap in one or more of the bones (vertebrae) of the spine",Spina bifida
"Because the spinal nerves usually aren't involved, most children with this form of spina bifida have no signs or symptoms and experience no neurological problems",Spina bifida
"Visible indications of spina bifida occulta can sometimes be seen on the newborn's skin above the spinal defect, including: An abnormal tuft of hair A collection of fat A small dimple or birthmark Many people who have spina bifida occulta don't even know it, unless the condition is discovered during an X-ray or other imaging test done for unrelated reasons",Spina bifida
"Meningocele In this rare form, the protective membranes around the spinal cord (meninges) push out through the opening in the vertebrae",Spina bifida
"Because the spinal cord develops normally, these membranes can be removed by surgery with little or no damage to nerve pathways",Spina bifida
"Myelomeningocele Also known as open spina bifida, myelomeningocele is the most severe form — and the form people usually mean when they use the term spina bifida",Spina bifida
"In myelomeningocele, the baby's spinal canal remains open along several vertebrae in the lower or middle back",Spina bifida
"Because of this opening, both the membranes and the spinal cord protrude at birth, forming a sac on the baby's back",Spina bifida
"In some cases, skin covers the sac",Spina bifida
"Usually, however, tissues and nerves are exposed, making the baby prone to life-threatening infections",Spina bifida
"Neurological impairment is common, including: Muscle weakness of the legs, sometimes involving paralysis Bowel and bladder problems Seizures, especially if the child requires a shunt Orthopedic problems — such as deformed feet, uneven hips and a curved spine (scoliosis)  ",Spina bifida

"Heart failure signs and symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, and swollen ankles and feet",Aortic valve stenosis
"Aortic valve stenosis often doesn't produce warning signs or symptoms right away, making it difficult to detect at first",Aortic valve stenosis
"You also may not recognize that you're experiencing symptoms",Aortic valve stenosis
"The condition is often discovered during a routine physical when your doctor hears an abnormal heart sound (heart murmur)",Aortic valve stenosis

"Because a child with Prader-Willi syndrome may always be hungry, he or she eats frequently and consumes large portions",Prader-Willi syndrome
"A child may develop unusual food-seeking behaviors, such as hoarding food or eating things such as garbage or frozen food",Prader-Willi syndrome
"Underdeveloped sex organs",Prader-Willi syndrome

"You'll have atrial fibrillation permanently, and you'll often require medications to control your heart rate",Atrial fibrillation
"Your doctor may order an electrocardiogram to determine if your symptoms are related to atrial fibrillation or another heart rhythm disorder (arrhythmia)",Atrial fibrillation
"If you have chest pain, seek emergency medical assistance immediately",Atrial fibrillation
"Chest pain could signal that you're having a heart attack",Atrial fibrillation
"Your heart consists of four chambers — two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles)",Atrial fibrillation
"Within the upper right chamber of your heart (right atrium) is a group of cells called the sinus node",Atrial fibrillation
"This is your heart's natural pacemaker",Atrial fibrillation
"The sinus node produces the impulse that normally starts each heartbeat",Atrial fibrillation
"Normally, the impulse travels first through the atria and then through a connecting pathway between the upper and lower chambers of your heart called the atrioventricular (AV) node",Atrial fibrillation
"As the signal passes from the sinus node through the atria, they contract, pumping blood from your atria into the ventricles below",Atrial fibrillation
"As the signal passes through the AV node to the ventricles, it signals the ventricles to contract, pumping blood out to your body",Atrial fibrillation
"In atrial fibrillation, the upper chambers of your heart (atria) experience chaotic electrical signals",Atrial fibrillation
"As a result, they quiver",Atrial fibrillation
"The AV node — the electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles — is bombarded with impulses trying to get through to the ventricles",Atrial fibrillation
"The ventricles also beat rapidly, but not as rapidly as the atria, as not all the impulses get through",Atrial fibrillation
"The reason is that the AV node is like a highway on-ramp — only so many vehicles can get on at one time",Atrial fibrillation
"The result is a fast and irregular heart rhythm",Atrial fibrillation
"The heart rate in atrial fibrillation may range from 100 to 175 beats a minute",Atrial fibrillation
"The normal range for a heart rate is 60 to 100 beats a minute",Atrial fibrillation
"Possible causes of atrial fibrillation Abnormalities or damage to the heart's structure are the most common cause of atrial fibrillation",Atrial fibrillation
"Possible causes of atrial fibrillation include: High blood pressure Heart attacks Coronary artery disease Abnormal heart valves Heart defects you're born with (congenital) An overactive thyroid gland or other metabolic imbalance Exposure to stimulants, such as medications, caffeine, tobacco or alcohol Sick sinus syndrome — improper functioning of the heart's natural pacemaker Lung diseases Previous heart surgery Viral infections Stress due to pneumonia, surgery or other illnesses Sleep apnea However, some people who have atrial fibrillation don't have any heart defects or damage, a condition called lone atrial fibrillation",Atrial fibrillation
"In lone atrial fibrillation, the cause is often unclear, and serious complications are rare",Atrial fibrillation
"Atrial flutter Atrial flutter is similar to atrial fibrillation, but the rhythm in your atria is more organized and less chaotic than the abnormal patterns common with atrial fibrillation",Atrial fibrillation
"Sometimes you may have atrial flutter that develops into atrial fibrillation and vice versa",Atrial fibrillation
"The risk factors for and the symptoms and causes of atrial flutter are similar to those of atrial fibrillation",Atrial fibrillation
"For example, strokes are also a concern in someone with atrial flutter",Atrial fibrillation

"It's the most common heart problem seen with Noonan syndrome, and it may occur alone or with other heart defects",Noonan syndrome
"Thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)",Noonan syndrome
"This is abnormal growth or thickening of the heart muscle that affects some people with Noonan syndrome",Noonan syndrome
"Other structural defects of the heart",Noonan syndrome
"The defects can involve a hole in the wall that separates the two lower chambers of the heart (ventricular septal defect), narrowing of the artery that carries blood to the lungs for oxygen (pulmonary artery stenosis), or narrowing of the major blood vessel (aorta) that carries blood from the heart to the body (aortic coarctation)",Noonan syndrome
"Irregular heart rhythm",Noonan syndrome
"This can occur with or without structural heart abnormalities",Noonan syndrome
"Irregular heart rhythm occurs in the majority of people with Noonan syndrome",Noonan syndrome

"Eating difficulties may result in inadequate nutrition and poor weight gain",Noonan syndrome
"Growth hormone levels may be insufficient",Noonan syndrome
"The growth spurt that's usually seen during the teenage years may be delayed",Noonan syndrome
"But because this disorder causes bone maturity to be delayed, growth sometimes continues into the late teens",Noonan syndrome

"Musculoskeletal issues Some common issues can include: An unusually shaped chest often with a sunken sternum (pectus excavatum) or raised sternum (pectus carinatum) Wide-set nipples Short neck, often with extra folds of skin (webbed neck) or prominent neck muscles (trapezius) Deformities of the spine Learning disabilities Intelligence isn't affected for most people with Noonan syndrome",Noonan syndrome
"However, individuals may have: An increased risk of learning disabilities and mild intellectual disability A wide range of mental, emotional and behavioral issues that are usually mild Hearing and vision deficits that may complicate learning Eye conditions A common sign of Noonan syndrome is abnormalities of the eyes and eyelids",Noonan syndrome
"These may include: Problems with the eye muscles, such as cross-eye (strabismus) Refractive problems, such as astigmatism, nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness (hyperopia) Rapid movement of the eyeballs (nystagmus) Cataracts Hearing problems Noonan syndrome can cause hearing deficits due to nerve issues or to structural abnormalities in the inner ear bones",Noonan syndrome
"Bleeding Noonan syndrome can cause excessive bleeding and bruising due to clotting defects or having too few platelets",Noonan syndrome
"Lymphatic conditions Noonan syndrome can cause problems with the lymphatic system, which drains excess fluid from the body and helps fight infection",Noonan syndrome
"These problems: May show up before or after birth or develop in the teenage years or adulthood Can be focused in a particular area of the body or widespread Most commonly cause excess fluid (lymphedema) on the back of the hands or top of the feet Genital and kidney conditions Many people, especially males, with Noonan syndrome can have problems with the genitals and kidneys",Noonan syndrome
"Testicles",Noonan syndrome

"If you suspect you or your child may have the disorder, see your primary care doctor or your child's pediatrician",Noonan syndrome
"You or your child may be referred to a geneticist or a cardiologist",Noonan syndrome
"If your unborn child is at risk because of a family history of Noonan syndrome, prenatal tests may be available",Noonan syndrome
"These mutations can occur in multiple genes",Noonan syndrome
"Defects in these genes cause the production of proteins that are continually active",Noonan syndrome
"Because these genes play a role in the formation of many tissues throughout the body, this constant activation of proteins disrupts the normal process of cell growth and division",Noonan syndrome
"The mutations that cause Noonan syndrome can be: Inherited",Noonan syndrome
"Children who have one parent with Noonan syndrome who carries the defective gene (autosomal dominant) have a 50 percent chance of developing the disorder",Noonan syndrome

"Things that may lead to, or cause, an episode include: Heart failure Thyroid disease Heart disease Chronic lung disease Smoking Drinking too much alcohol Consuming too much caffeine Drug use, such as cocaine and methamphetamines Certain medications, including asthma medications and over-the-counter cold and allergy drugs Surgery Pregnancy Certain health conditions, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome What's a normal heartbeat? Normal heartbeat Normal heartbeat Supraventricular tachycardia Supraventricular tachycardia Your heart is made up of four chambers — two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles)",Atrial tachycardia
"The rhythm of your heart is normally controlled by a natural pacemaker (the sinus node) located in the right atrium",Atrial tachycardia
"The sinus node produces electrical impulses that normally start each heartbeat",Atrial tachycardia
"From the sinus node, electrical impulses travel across the atria, causing the atria muscles to contract and pump blood into the ventricles",Atrial tachycardia
"The electrical impulses then arrive at a cluster of cells called the atrioventricular node (AV node) — usually the only pathway for signals to travel from the atria to the ventricles",Atrial tachycardia
"The AV node slows down the electrical signal before sending it to the ventricles",Atrial tachycardia
"This slight delay allows the ventricles to fill with blood",Atrial tachycardia
"When electrical impulses reach the muscles of the ventricles, they contract, causing them to pump blood either to the lungs or to the rest of the body",Atrial tachycardia
"In a healthy heart, this process usually goes smoothly, resulting in a normal resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats a minute",Atrial tachycardia
"Supraventricular tachycardia occurs when faulty electrical connections in the heart or abnormal areas of electrical activity trigger and sustain an abnormal rhythm",Atrial tachycardia
"When this happens, the heart rate accelerates too quickly and doesn't allow enough time for the heart to fill before it contracts again",Atrial tachycardia
"These ineffective contractions of the heart may cause you to feel light-headed or dizzy because the brain isn't receiving enough blood and oxygen",Atrial tachycardia
"Types of supraventricular tachycardia There are three major types of supraventricular tachycardia: Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT)",Atrial tachycardia
"This is the most common type of supraventricular tachycardia in both males and females of any age, although it tends to occur more often in young women",Atrial tachycardia
"Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT)",Atrial tachycardia
"AVRT is the second most-common type of supraventricular tachycardia",Atrial tachycardia
"It's most commonly diagnosed in younger people",Atrial tachycardia
"Atrial tachycardia",Atrial tachycardia
"This type of supraventricular tachycardia is more commonly diagnosed in people with coexisting heart disease",Atrial tachycardia
"Unlike AVNRT and AVRT, which always involve the AV node as part of the faulty connection, atrial tachycardia doesn't involve the AV node",Atrial tachycardia
"It also tends to occur twice as often in women, particularly pregnant women, though it may occur in either sex",Atrial tachycardia
"Other factors that may increase your risk of supraventricular tachycardia include: Age",Atrial tachycardia
"Some types of supraventricular tachycardia are more common in people who are middle-aged or older",Atrial tachycardia
"Coronary artery disease, other heart problems and previous heart surgery",Atrial tachycardia
"Narrowed heart arteries, a heart attack, abnormal heart valves, prior heart surgery, heart failure, cardiomyopathy and other heart damage increase your risk of developing supraventricular tachycardia",Atrial tachycardia

"Nicotine and illegal drug use",Atrial tachycardia
"Nicotine and illegal drugs, such as amphetamines and cocaine, may profoundly affect the heart and trigger an episode of supraventricular tachycardia",Atrial tachycardia
"In extreme cases, an episode of supraventricular tachycardia may cause unconsciousness or cardiac arrest",Atrial tachycardia
"Signs and symptoms such as a fever and sore throat usually lessen within a couple of weeks, but fatigue, enlarged lymph nodes and a swollen spleen may last for a few weeks longer",Mononucleosis

"Some conditions that increase a baby's size might also increase his or her urine output",Fetal macrosomia
"Your brain and spinal cord are surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, which acts like a cushion to protect these vital tissues from injury",Pseudotumor cerebri
"This fluid is produced in the brain and eventually is absorbed into the bloodstream",Pseudotumor cerebri
"The increased intracranial pressure of pseudotumor cerebri may be a result of a problem in this absorption process",Pseudotumor cerebri
"In general, your intracranial pressure increases when the contents of your skull exceed its capacity",Pseudotumor cerebri
"For example, a brain tumor generally increases your intracranial pressure because there's no room for the tumor",Pseudotumor cerebri
"The same thing happens if your brain swells or if you have too much cerebrospinal fluid",Pseudotumor cerebri
"Several studies indicate that many people with pseudotumor cerebri have a narrowing (stenosis) in two large sinuses in the brain (transverse sinuses)",Pseudotumor cerebri
"Studies are determining whether this is an effect or a cause of the condition",Pseudotumor cerebri
"In women who are obese, about 4 to 21 in 100,000 develop the condition",Pseudotumor cerebri
"Women under the age of 44 who are obese are more likely to develop the disorder",Pseudotumor cerebri

"If the glands secrete too much parathyroid hormone, the amount of calcium in your blood rises — which triggers a rise in blood pressure",Secondary high blood pressure
"Coarctation of the aorta",Secondary high blood pressure
"With this defect you're born with, the body's main artery (aorta) is narrowed (coarctation)",Secondary high blood pressure
"This forces the heart to pump harder to get blood through the aorta and to the rest of your body",Secondary high blood pressure
"This, in turn, raises blood pressure — particularly in your arms",Secondary high blood pressure
"Sleep apnea",Secondary high blood pressure
"In this condition, often marked by severe snoring, breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep, causing you to not get enough oxygen",Secondary high blood pressure
"Not getting enough oxygen may damage the lining of the blood vessel walls, which may make your blood vessels less effective in regulating your blood pressure",Secondary high blood pressure

"Living in a community setting",Meningitis
"College students living in dormitories, personnel on military bases, and children in boarding schools and child care facilities are at greater risk of meningococcal meningitis",Meningitis
"This is probably because the bacterium is spread by the respiratory route, and spreads quickly through large groups",Meningitis
"Pregnancy increases the risk of listeriosis — an infection caused by listeria bacteria, which also may cause meningitis",Meningitis
"Listeriosis increases the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and premature delivery",Meningitis
"Compromised immune system",Meningitis

"If the child receives a Y chromosome from the father, the XY pair means the child is genetically a male",Triple X syndrome
"Females with triple X syndrome have a third X chromosome from a random error in cell division",Triple X syndrome
"This error can happen before conception or early in the embryo's development, resulting in one of these forms of triple X syndrome: Nondisjunction",Triple X syndrome
"In most cases, either the mother's egg cell or the father's sperm cell divides incorrectly, resulting in an extra X chromosome in the child",Triple X syndrome
"This random error is called nondisjunction, and all the cells in the child's body will have the extra X chromosome",Triple X syndrome
"Mosaic",Triple X syndrome
"Occasionally, the extra chromosome results from an incorrect cell division caused by a random event early in the embryo's development",Triple X syndrome
"If this is the case, the child has a mosaic form of triple X syndrome, and only some cells have the extra X chromosome",Triple X syndrome
"So females with the mosaic form may have less obvious symptoms",Triple X syndrome
"Triple X syndrome is also called 47,XXX syndrome because the extra X chromosome results in 47 chromosomes in each cell instead of the usual 46",Triple X syndrome

"In fact, your doctor might find you have an arrhythmia before you do, during a routine examination",Heart arrhythmias
"Noticeable signs and symptoms don't necessarily mean you have a serious problem, however",Heart arrhythmias
"Other signs and symptoms may be related to your heart not pumping effectively due to the fast or slow heartbeat",Heart arrhythmias
"These include shortness of breath, weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting or near fainting, and chest pain or discomfort",Heart arrhythmias
"Ventricular fibrillation is one type of arrhythmia that can be deadly",Heart arrhythmias
"It occurs when the heart beats with rapid, erratic electrical impulses",Heart arrhythmias
"This causes pumping chambers in your heart (the ventricles) to quiver uselessly instead of pumping blood",Heart arrhythmias
"Without an effective heartbeat, blood pressure plummets, cutting off blood supply to your vital organs",Heart arrhythmias
"A person with ventricular fibrillation will collapse within seconds and soon won't be breathing or have a pulse",Heart arrhythmias
"If this occurs, follow these steps: Call 911 or the emergency number in your area",Heart arrhythmias
"If there's no one nearby trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), provide hands-only CPR",Heart arrhythmias
"That means uninterrupted chest compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 a minute until paramedics arrive",Heart arrhythmias
"To do chest compressions, push hard and fast in the center of the chest",Heart arrhythmias
"You don't need to do rescue breathing",Heart arrhythmias
"If you or someone nearby knows CPR, begin providing it if it's needed",Heart arrhythmias
"CPR can help maintain blood flow to the organs until an electrical shock (defibrillation) can be given",Heart arrhythmias

"These portable defibrillators, which can deliver an electric shock that may restart heartbeats, are available in an increasing number of places, such as in airplanes, police cars and shopping malls",Heart arrhythmias
"They can even be purchased for your home",Heart arrhythmias
"No training is required",Heart arrhythmias
"The AED will tell you what to do",Heart arrhythmias
"It's programmed to allow a shock only when appropriate",Heart arrhythmias
"Types of arrhythmias Doctors classify arrhythmias not only by where they originate (atria or ventricles) but also by the speed of heart rate they cause: Tachycardia (tak-ih-KAHR-dee-uh)",Heart arrhythmias
"This refers to a fast heartbeat — a resting heart rate greater than 100 beats a minute",Heart arrhythmias
"Bradycardia (brad-e-KAHR-dee-uh)",Heart arrhythmias
"This refers to a slow heartbeat — a resting heart rate less than 60 beats a minute",Heart arrhythmias
"Not all tachycardias or bradycardias mean you have heart disease",Heart arrhythmias
"For example, during exercise it's normal to develop a fast heartbeat as the heart speeds up to provide your tissues with more oxygen-rich blood",Heart arrhythmias
"During sleep or times of deep relaxation, it's not unusual for the heartbeat to be slower",Heart arrhythmias
"Tachycardias in the atria Tachycardias originating in the atria include: Atrial fibrillation",Heart arrhythmias
"Atrial fibrillation is a rapid heart rate caused by chaotic electrical impulses in the atria",Heart arrhythmias
"These signals result in rapid, uncoordinated, weak contractions of the atria",Heart arrhythmias
"The chaotic electrical signals bombard the AV node, usually resulting in an irregular, rapid rhythm of the ventricles",Heart arrhythmias
"Atrial fibrillation may be temporary, but some episodes won't end unless treated",Heart arrhythmias
"Atrial fibrillation may lead to serious complications such as stroke",Heart arrhythmias
"Atrial flutter",Heart arrhythmias
"Atrial flutter is similar to atrial fibrillation",Heart arrhythmias
"The heartbeats in atrial flutter are more-organized and more-rhythmic electrical impulses than in atrial fibrillation",Heart arrhythmias
"Atrial flutter may also lead to serious complications such as stroke",Heart arrhythmias
"Supraventricular tachycardia",Heart arrhythmias
"Supraventricular tachycardia is a broad term that includes many forms of arrhythmia originating above the ventricles (supraventricular) in the atria or AV node",Heart arrhythmias
"Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome",Heart arrhythmias
"In Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, a type of supraventricular tachycardia, there is an extra electrical pathway between the atria and the ventricles, which is present at birth",Heart arrhythmias
"However, you may not experience symptoms until you're an adult",Heart arrhythmias
"This pathway may allow electrical signals to pass between the atria and the ventricles without passing through the AV node, leading to short circuits and rapid heartbeats",Heart arrhythmias
"Tachycardias in the ventricles Tachycardias occurring in the ventricles include: Ventricular tachycardia",Heart arrhythmias
"Ventricular tachycardia is a rapid, regular heart rate that originates with abnormal electrical signals in the ventricles",Heart arrhythmias
"The rapid heart rate doesn't allow the ventricles to fill and contract efficiently to pump enough blood to the body",Heart arrhythmias
"Ventricular tachycardia can often be a medical emergency",Heart arrhythmias
"Without prompt medical treatment, ventricular tachycardia may worsen into ventricular fibrillation",Heart arrhythmias
"Ventricular fibrillation",Heart arrhythmias
"Ventricular fibrillation occurs when rapid, chaotic electrical impulses cause the ventricles to quiver ineffectively instead of pumping necessary blood to the body",Heart arrhythmias
"This serious problem is fatal if the heart isn't restored to a normal rhythm within minutes",Heart arrhythmias
"Most people who experience ventricular fibrillation have an underlying heart disease or have experienced serious trauma, such as being struck by lightning",Heart arrhythmias
"Long QT syndrome",Heart arrhythmias
"Long QT syndrome is a heart disorder that carries an increased risk of fast, chaotic heartbeats",Heart arrhythmias
"The rapid heartbeats, caused by changes in the electrical system of your heart, may lead to fainting, and can be life-threatening",Heart arrhythmias
"In some cases, your heart's rhythm may be so erratic that it can cause sudden death",Heart arrhythmias
"You can be born with a genetic mutation that puts you at risk of long QT syndrome",Heart arrhythmias
"In addition, several medications may cause long QT syndrome",Heart arrhythmias
"Some medical conditions, such as congenital heart defects, may also cause long QT syndrome",Heart arrhythmias
"Bradycardia — A slow heartbeat Although a heart rate below 60 beats a minute while at rest is considered bradycardia, a low resting heart rate doesn't always signal a problem",Heart arrhythmias
"If you're physically fit, you may have an efficient heart capable of pumping an adequate supply of blood with fewer than 60 beats a minute at rest",Heart arrhythmias
"In addition, certain medications used to treat other conditions, such as high blood pressure, may lower your heart rate",Heart arrhythmias
"However, if you have a slow heart rate and your heart isn't pumping enough blood, you may have one of several bradycardias, including: Sick sinus syndrome",Heart arrhythmias
"If your sinus node, which is responsible for setting the pace of your heart, isn't sending impulses properly, your heart rate may be too slow (bradycardia), or it may speed up (tachycardia) and slow down intermittently",Heart arrhythmias
"Sick sinus syndrome can also be caused by scarring near the sinus node that's slowing, disrupting or blocking the travel of impulses",Heart arrhythmias
"Conduction block",Heart arrhythmias
"A block of your heart's electrical pathways can occur in or near the AV node, which lies on the pathway between your atria and your ventricles",Heart arrhythmias
"A block can also occur along other pathways to each ventricle",Heart arrhythmias
"Depending on the location and type of block, the impulses between the upper and lower halves of your heart may be slowed or blocked",Heart arrhythmias
"If the signal is completely blocked, certain cells in the AV node or ventricles can make a steady, although usually slower, heartbeat",Heart arrhythmias
"Some blocks may cause no signs or symptoms, and others may cause skipped beats or bradycardia",Heart arrhythmias
"Premature heartbeats Although it often feels like a skipped heartbeat, a premature heartbeat is actually an extra beat",Heart arrhythmias
"Even though you may feel an occasional premature beat, it seldom means you have a more serious problem",Heart arrhythmias
"Still, a premature beat can trigger a longer lasting arrhythmia — especially in people with heart disease",Heart arrhythmias
"Premature heartbeats are commonly caused by stress, strenuous exercise or stimulants, such as caffeine or nicotine",Heart arrhythmias
"These include: Coronary artery disease, other heart problems and previous heart surgery",Heart arrhythmias
"Narrowed heart arteries, a heart attack, abnormal heart valves, prior heart surgery, heart failure, cardiomyopathy and other heart damage are risk factors for almost any kind of arrhythmia",Heart arrhythmias
"This increases your risk of developing coronary artery disease",Heart arrhythmias
"It may also cause the walls of your left ventricle to become stiff and thick, which can change how electrical impulses travel through your heart",Heart arrhythmias
"Having an overactive or underactive thyroid gland can raise your risk of arrhythmias",Heart arrhythmias
"Certain over-the-counter cough and cold medicines and certain prescription drugs may contribute to arrhythmia development",Heart arrhythmias
"This disorder, in which your breathing is interrupted during sleep, can increase your risk of bradycardia, atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias",Heart arrhythmias
"Electrolyte imbalance",Heart arrhythmias
"Substances in your blood called electrolytes — such as potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium — help trigger and conduct the electrical impulses in your heart",Heart arrhythmias
"Electrolyte levels that are too high or too low can affect your heart's electrical impulses and contribute to arrhythmia development",Heart arrhythmias
"Drinking too much alcohol",Heart arrhythmias
"Drinking too much alcohol can affect the electrical impulses in your heart and can increase the chance of developing atrial fibrillation",Heart arrhythmias
"Caffeine or nicotine use",Heart arrhythmias
"Caffeine, nicotine and other stimulants can cause your heart to beat faster and may contribute to the development of more-serious arrhythmias",Heart arrhythmias
"Illegal drugs, such as amphetamines and cocaine, may profoundly affect the heart and lead to many types of arrhythmias or to sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation",Heart arrhythmias
"However, seek medical attention right away if you have trouble breathing",Atelectasis
"Other conditions besides atelectasis can cause breathing difficulties and require an accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment",Atelectasis
"If your breathing becomes increasingly difficult, seek emergency care",Atelectasis
"For others, signs and symptoms — which usually begin within two to 11 days of eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water — may include: Frequent, watery diarrhea Bouts of diarrhea alternating with bouts of constipation Loss of appetite and weight loss Bloating, flatulence and burping Stomach cramps Nausea and vomiting Muscle aches Fever Fatigue — this symptom may last long after the active infection has gotten better General feeling of unwellness (malaise) The diarrhea may end by itself within a few days, or it may last for weeks",Cyclospora infection

"Some smokers develop less common lung conditions",COPD
"They may be misdiagnosed as having COPD until a more thorough evaluation is performed",COPD
"How your lungs are affected Air travels down your windpipe (trachea) and into your lungs through two large tubes (bronchi)",COPD
"Inside your lungs, these tubes divide many times — like the branches of a tree — into many smaller tubes (bronchioles) that end in clusters of tiny air sacs (alveoli)",COPD
"The air sacs have very thin walls full of tiny blood vessels (capillaries)",COPD
"The oxygen in the air you inhale passes into these blood vessels and enters your bloodstream",COPD
"At the same time, carbon dioxide — a gas that is a waste product of metabolism — is exhaled",COPD
"Your lungs rely on the natural elasticity of the bronchial tubes and air sacs to force air out of your body",COPD
"COPD causes them to lose their elasticity and overexpand, which leaves some air trapped in your lungs when you exhale",COPD
"This lung disease causes destruction of the fragile walls and elastic fibers of the alveoli",COPD

"Other irritants can cause COPD , including cigar smoke, secondhand smoke, pipe smoke, air pollution and workplace exposure to dust, smoke or fumes",COPD
"Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency In about 1 percent of people with COPD , the disease results from a genetic disorder that causes low levels of a protein called alpha-1-antitrypsin",COPD
"Alpha-1-antitrypsin ( AAt ) is made in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream to help protect the lungs",COPD
"Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency can affect the liver as well as the lungs",COPD
"Damage to the lung can occur in infants and children, not only adults with long smoking histories",COPD
"For adults with COPD related to AAt deficiency, treatment options include those used for people with more-common types of COPD ",COPD
"In addition, some people can be treated by replacing the missing AAt protein, which may prevent further damage to the lungs",COPD
"The most significant risk factor for COPD is long-term cigarette smoking",COPD

"Other parasites may be transmitted to humans from animal feces",General infectious diseases
"Direct contact An easy way to catch most infectious diseases is by coming in contact with a person or animal who has the infection",General infectious diseases
"Three ways infectious diseases can be spread through direct contact are: Person to person",General infectious diseases
"A common way for infectious diseases to spread is through the direct transfer of bacteria, viruses or other germs from one person to another",General infectious diseases
"This can occur when an individual with the bacterium or virus touches, kisses, or coughs or sneezes on someone who isn't infected",General infectious diseases
"These germs can also spread through the exchange of body fluids from sexual contact",General infectious diseases
"The person who passes the germ may have no symptoms of the disease, but may simply be a carrier",General infectious diseases
"Animal to person",General infectious diseases
"Being bitten or scratched by an infected animal — even a pet — can make you sick and, in extreme circumstances, can be fatal",General infectious diseases

"Sometimes, however, the problem develops quickly, and you may experience a sudden onset of severe signs and symptoms",Mitral valve regurgitation
"If you develop symptoms that suggest mitral valve regurgitation or another problem with your heart, see your doctor right away",Mitral valve regurgitation
"Sometimes the first indications are actually those of mitral valve regurgitation's complications, including heart failure, a condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs",Mitral valve regurgitation
"Four heart valves open and close to let blood flow in only one direction through your heart",Mitral valve regurgitation
"The mitral valve — which lies between the two chambers on the left side of your heart — is comprised of two flaps of tissue called leaflets",Mitral valve regurgitation
"The mitral valve opens when blood flows from the left atrium to the left ventricle",Mitral valve regurgitation
"Then the flaps close to prevent the blood that has just passed into the left ventricle from flowing backward",Mitral valve regurgitation
"In mitral valve regurgitation, the mitral valve doesn't close tightly",Mitral valve regurgitation
"With each heartbeat, some blood from the left ventricle flows backward into the left atrium instead of moving forward into the aorta",Mitral valve regurgitation
"This essentially means that the heart pulls blood backward",Mitral valve regurgitation
"Mitral valve regurgitation causes Mitral valve regurgitation is classified as primary and secondary",Mitral valve regurgitation
"Primary mitral valve regurgitation is caused by an abnormality in the mitral valve",Mitral valve regurgitation
"Secondary mitral valve regurgitation is caused by an abnormality in the left ventricle of the heart",Mitral valve regurgitation
"Possible causes of mitral valve regurgitation include: Mitral valve prolapse",Mitral valve regurgitation
"In this condition, the leaflets and tendon-like cords supporting the mitral valve weaken and stretch so that with each contraction of the left ventricle, the valve leaflets bulge (prolapse) into the left atrium",Mitral valve regurgitation
"This common heart defect can prevent the mitral valve from closing tightly and lead to regurgitation",Mitral valve regurgitation
"Damaged tissue cords",Mitral valve regurgitation
"Over time, the tissue cords that anchor the flaps of the mitral valve to the heart wall may stretch or tear, especially in people with mitral valve prolapse",Mitral valve regurgitation

"Some children show signs of ASD in early infancy",Autism spectrum disorder
"Other children may develop normally for the first few months or years of life, but then suddenly become withdrawn or aggressive or lose language skills they've already acquired",Autism spectrum disorder
"Each child with ASD is likely to have a unique pattern of behavior and level of severity — from low functioning to high functioning",Autism spectrum disorder
"Severity is based on social communication impairments and the restrictive and repetitive nature of behaviors, along with how these impact the ability to function",Autism spectrum disorder
"Because of the unique mixture of symptoms shown in each child, severity level can sometimes be difficult to determine",Autism spectrum disorder
"However, within the range (spectrum) of symptoms, below are some common ASD actions and behaviors",Autism spectrum disorder
"Other children with ASD have normal to high intelligence — they learn quickly, yet have trouble communicating and applying what they know in everyday life and adjusting to social situations",Autism spectrum disorder

"Cortisol, which is produced in the adrenal glands, plays a variety of roles in your body",Cushing's syndrome
"For example, cortisol helps regulate your blood pressure and keeps your cardiovascular system functioning normally",Cushing's syndrome
"Cortisol also helps your body respond to stress and regulates the way you convert (metabolize) proteins, carbohydrates and fats in your diet into usable energy",Cushing's syndrome
"However, when the level of cortisol is too high in your body, you may develop Cushing syndrome",Cushing's syndrome
"The role of corticosteroid medications Cushing syndrome can develop from a cause outside of your body (exogenous Cushing syndrome)",Cushing's syndrome
"One example is taking oral corticosteroid medications in high doses over an extended period of time",Cushing's syndrome
"These medications, such as prednisone, have the same effect in the body as does cortisol produced by your body",Cushing's syndrome
"Oral corticosteroids may be necessary to treat inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and asthma, or to prevent your body from rejecting a transplanted organ",Cushing's syndrome
"Because the doses required to treat these conditions are often higher than the amount of cortisol your body normally needs each day, side effects from excess cortisol can occur",Cushing's syndrome
"It's also possible to develop Cushing syndrome from injectable corticosteroids — for example, repeated injections for joint pain, bursitis and back pain",Cushing's syndrome
"Inhaled steroid medicines (taken for asthma) and steroid skin creams (used for skin disorders such as eczema) are generally less likely to cause Cushing syndrome than oral corticosteroids",Cushing's syndrome
"But, in some individuals, these medications may cause Cushing syndrome, especially if taken in high doses",Cushing's syndrome
"Your body's own overproduction The condition may also be due to your body's own overproduction of cortisol (endogenous Cushing syndrome)",Cushing's syndrome
"This may occur from excess production by one or both adrenal glands, or overproduction of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which normally regulates cortisol production, In these cases, Cushing syndrome may be related to: A pituitary gland tumor (pituitary adenoma)",Cushing's syndrome
"A noncancerous (benign) tumor of the pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain, secretes an excess amount of ACTH, which in turn stimulates the adrenal glands to make more cortisol",Cushing's syndrome
"When this form of the syndrome develops, it's called Cushing disease",Cushing's syndrome
"It occurs much more often in women and is the most common form of endogenous Cushing syndrome",Cushing's syndrome
"An ectopic ACTH-secreting tumor",Cushing's syndrome
"Rarely, when a tumor develops in an organ that normally does not produce ACTH, the tumor will begin to secrete this hormone in excess, resulting in Cushing syndrome",Cushing's syndrome
"These tumors, which can be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant), are usually found in the lungs, pancreas, thyroid or thymus gland",Cushing's syndrome
"A primary adrenal gland disease",Cushing's syndrome
"In some people, the cause of Cushing syndrome is excess cortisol secretion that doesn't depend on stimulation from ACTH and is associated with disorders of the adrenal glands",Cushing's syndrome
"The most common of these disorders is a noncancerous tumor of the adrenal cortex, called an adrenal adenoma",Cushing's syndrome
"Cancerous tumors of the adrenal cortex (adrenocortical carcinomas) are rare, but they can cause Cushing syndrome as well",Cushing's syndrome
"Occasionally, benign, nodular enlargement of both adrenal glands can result in Cushing syndrome",Cushing's syndrome
"Familial Cushing syndrome",Cushing's syndrome
"Rarely, people inherit a tendency to develop tumors on one or more of their endocrine glands, affecting cortisol levels and causing Cushing syndrome",Cushing's syndrome

"Signs and symptoms may never return, or the disease may progress to the tertiary (third) stage",Syphilis
"Tertiary (late) syphilis About 15 to 30 percent of people infected with syphilis who don't get treatment will develop complications known as tertiary (late) syphilis",Syphilis
"In the late stages, the disease may damage your brain, nerves, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones and joints",Syphilis
"These problems may occur many years after the original, untreated infection",Syphilis
"Congenital syphilis Babies born to women who have syphilis can become infected through the placenta or during birth",Syphilis
"Most newborns with congenital syphilis have no symptoms, although some experience a rash on the palms of their hands and the soles of their feet",Syphilis
"Later symptoms may include deafness, teeth deformities and saddle nose — where the bridge of the nose collapses",Syphilis
"The most common route of transmission is through contact with an infected person's sore during sexual activity",Syphilis
"The bacteria enter your body through minor cuts or abrasions in your skin or mucous membranes",Syphilis
"Syphilis is contagious during its primary and secondary stages, and sometimes in the early latent period",Syphilis
"Less commonly, syphilis may spread through direct unprotected close contact with an active lesion (such as during kissing) or through an infected mother to her baby during pregnancy or childbirth (congenital syphilis)",Syphilis
"Syphilis can't be spread by using the same toilet, bathtub, clothing or eating utensils, or from doorknobs, swimming pools or hot tubs",Syphilis
"Once cured, syphilis doesn't recur on its own",Syphilis
"However, you can become reinfected if you have contact with someone's syphilis sore",Syphilis

"In some people, certain factors, such as those below, may trigger lichen planus",Lichen planus
"But the condition most often affects middle-aged adults",Lichen planus
"Sexual dysfunction can become a long-term complication",Lichen planus
"There is some evidence that lichen planus may increase your risk of a skin cancer known as squamous cell carcinoma, though the risk is small",Lichen planus
"Your doctor may recommend routine screening for evidence of cancerous cells in tissues affected by lichen planus",Lichen planus
"For many people the affected skin might stay slightly darker even after the rash clears up",Lichen planus

"Obsession symptoms OCD obsessions are repeated, persistent and unwanted thoughts, urges or images that are intrusive and cause distress or anxiety",Obsessive compulsive disorder
"You might try to ignore them or get rid of them by performing a compulsive behavior or ritual",Obsessive compulsive disorder
"These obsessions typically intrude when you're trying to think of or do other things",Obsessive compulsive disorder
"Obsessions often have themes to them, such as: Fear of contamination or dirt Needing things orderly and symmetrical Aggressive or horrific thoughts about harming yourself or others Unwanted thoughts, including aggression, or sexual or religious subjects Examples of obsession signs and symptoms include: Fear of being contaminated by touching objects others have touched Doubts that you've locked the door or turned off the stove Intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way Images of hurting yourself or someone else that are unwanted and make you uncomfortable Thoughts about shouting obscenities or acting inappropriately that are unwanted and make you uncomfortable Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions, such as shaking hands Distress about unpleasant sexual images repeating in your mind Compulsion symptoms OCD compulsions are repetitive behaviors that you feel driven to perform",Obsessive compulsive disorder
"These repetitive behaviors or mental acts are meant to prevent or reduce anxiety related to your obsessions or prevent something bad from happening",Obsessive compulsive disorder
"However, engaging in the compulsions brings no pleasure and may offer only a temporary relief from anxiety",Obsessive compulsive disorder
"You may make up rules or rituals to follow that help control your anxiety when you're having obsessive thoughts",Obsessive compulsive disorder
"These compulsions are excessive and often are not realistically related to the problem they're intended to fix",Obsessive compulsive disorder

"A growth on the brain, cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign), can damage the cerebellum",Ataxia
"Toxic reaction",Ataxia
"Ataxia is a potential side effect of certain medications, especially barbiturates, such as phenobarbital; sedatives, such as benzodiazepines; and some types of chemotherapy",Ataxia
"These are important to identify because the effects are often reversible",Ataxia
"Also, some medications you take can cause problems as you age, so you might need to reduce your dose or discontinue the medication",Ataxia
"Alcohol and drug intoxication; heavy metal poisoning, such as from lead or mercury; and solvent poisoning, such as from paint thinner, also can cause ataxia",Ataxia
"Vitamin E, vitamin B-12 or thiamine deficiency",Ataxia
"Not getting enough of these nutrients,because of the inability to absorb enough, alcohol abuse or other reasons, can lead to ataxia",Ataxia
"For some adults who develop sporadic ataxia, no specific cause can be found",Ataxia
"Sporadic ataxia can take a number of forms, including multiple system atrophy, a progressive, degenerative disorder",Ataxia
"Hereditary ataxias Some types of ataxia and some conditions that cause ataxia are hereditary",Ataxia
"If you have one of these conditions, you were born with a defect in a certain gene that makes abnormal proteins",Ataxia
"The abnormal proteins hamper the function of nerve cells, primarily in your cerebellum and spinal cord, and cause them to degenerate",Ataxia
"As the disease progresses, coordination problems worsen",Ataxia
"You can inherit a genetic ataxia from either a dominant gene from one parent (autosomal dominant disorder) or a recessive gene from each parent (autosomal recessive disorder)",Ataxia
"In the latter case, it's possible neither parent has the disorder (silent mutation), so there might be no obvious family history",Ataxia
"Different gene defects cause different types of ataxia, most of which are progressive",Ataxia
"Each type causes poor coordination, but each has specific signs and symptoms",Ataxia
"Autosomal dominant ataxias Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern These include: Spinocerebellar ataxias",Ataxia
"Researchers have labeled more than 35 autosomal dominant ataxia genes, and the number continues to grow",Ataxia
"Cerebellar ataxia and cerebellar degeneration are common to all types, but other signs and symptoms, as well as age of onset, differ depending on the specific gene mutation",Ataxia
"Episodic ataxia (EA)",Ataxia
"There are seven recognized types of ataxia that are episodic rather than progressive — EA1 through EA7",Ataxia
"EA1 and EA2 are the most common",Ataxia
"EA1 involves brief ataxic episodes that may last seconds or minutes",Ataxia
"The episodes are triggered by stress, being startled or sudden movement, and often are associated with muscle twitching",Ataxia
"EA2 involves longer episodes, usually lasting from 30 minutes to six hours, that also are triggered by stress",Ataxia
"You might have dizziness (vertigo), fatigue and muscle weakness during your episodes",Ataxia

"Primary infection (Acute HIV) The majority of people infected by HIV develop a flu-like illness within a month or two after the virus enters the body",HIV/AIDS
"This illness, known as primary or acute HIV infection, may last for a few weeks",HIV/AIDS
"Possible signs and symptoms include: Fever Headache Muscle aches and joint pain Rash Sore throat Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck Although the symptoms of primary HIV infection may be mild enough to go unnoticed, the amount of virus in the bloodstream (viral load) is particularly high at this time",HIV/AIDS
"As a result, HIV infection spreads more efficiently during primary infection than during the next stage of infection",HIV/AIDS
"Clinical latent infection (Chronic HIV) In some people, persistent swelling of lymph nodes occurs during clinical latent HIV",HIV/AIDS
"Otherwise, there are no specific signs and symptoms",HIV/AIDS
"HIV remains in the body, however, and in infected white blood cells",HIV/AIDS
"Clinical latent infection generally lasts around 10 years if you're not receiving antiretroviral therapy",HIV/AIDS
"This phase can last for decades in people taking antiretroviral medications",HIV/AIDS
"But some people progress to more severe disease much sooner",HIV/AIDS
"Early symptomatic HIV infection As the virus continues to multiply and destroy immune cells, you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as: Fever Fatigue Swollen lymph nodes — often one of the first signs of HIV infection Diarrhea Weight loss Oral yeast infection (thrush) Shingles (herpes zoster) Progression to AIDS If you receive no treatment for your HIV infection, the disease typically progresses to AIDS in about 10 years",HIV/AIDS
"By the time AIDS develops, your immune system has been severely damaged, making you susceptible to opportunistic infections — diseases that wouldn't usually trouble a person with a healthy immune system",HIV/AIDS
"Injury to or dislocation of the hip joint — which can occur during car accidents or from playing contact sports such as football or hockey — can cause a hip labral tear",Hip labral tear

"Retinoblastoma is a rare cancer, so your child's doctor may explore other more common eye conditions first",Retinoblastoma
"If you have a family history of retinoblastoma, ask your pediatrician when your child should begin regular eye exams to screen for retinoblastoma",Retinoblastoma
"These mutations cause the cells to continue growing and multiplying when healthy cells would die",Retinoblastoma
"This accumulating mass of cells forms a tumor",Retinoblastoma
"Retinoblastoma cells can invade further into the eye and nearby structures",Retinoblastoma
"Retinoblastoma can also spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body, including the brain and spine",Retinoblastoma
"In the majority of cases, it's not clear what causes the genetic mutations that lead to retinoblastoma",Retinoblastoma
"However, it's possible for children to inherit a genetic mutation from their parents",Retinoblastoma
"Retinoblastoma that is inherited Gene mutations that increase the risk of retinoblastoma and other cancers can be passed from parents to children",Retinoblastoma
"Hereditary retinoblastoma is passed from parents to children in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means only one parent needs a single copy of the mutated gene to pass the increased risk of retinoblastoma on to the children",Retinoblastoma
"If one parent carries a mutated gene, each child has a 50 percent chance of inheriting that gene",Retinoblastoma
"Although a genetic mutation increases a child's risk of retinoblastoma, it doesn't mean that cancer is inevitable",Retinoblastoma
"Children with the inherited form of retinoblastoma tend to develop the disease at an earlier age",Retinoblastoma
"Hereditary retinoblastoma also tends to occur in both eyes, as opposed to just one eye",Retinoblastoma
"For this reason, your child's doctor will schedule follow-up exams to check for recurrent retinoblastoma",Retinoblastoma
"The doctor may design a personalized follow-up exam schedule for your child",Retinoblastoma
"In most cases, this will likely involve eye exams every few months for the first few years after retinoblastoma treatment ends",Retinoblastoma
"Additionally, children with the inherited form of retinoblastoma have an increased risk of developing other types of cancers in any part of the body in the years after treatment",Retinoblastoma
"For this reason, children with inherited retinoblastoma may have regular exams to screen for other cancers",Retinoblastoma
"If you don't have any signs or symptoms, but are worried about your risk of cancer, discuss your concerns with your doctor",Cancer
"Ask about which cancer screening tests and procedures are appropriate for you",Cancer
"For this reason, doctors make a distinction between: Latent TB",Tuberculosis
"In this condition, you have a TB infection, but the bacteria remain in your body in an inactive state and cause no symptoms",Tuberculosis
"Latent TB, also called inactive TB or TB infection, isn't contagious",Tuberculosis
"It can turn into active TB, so treatment is important for the person with latent TB and to help control the spread of TB",Tuberculosis
"An estimated 2 billion people have latent TB",Tuberculosis
"Active TB",Tuberculosis
"This condition makes you sick and can spread to others",Tuberculosis
"It can occur in the first few weeks after infection with the TB bacteria, or it might occur years later",Tuberculosis
"Signs and symptoms of active TB include: Coughing that lasts three or more weeks Coughing up blood Chest pain, or pain with breathing or coughing Unintentional weight loss Fatigue Fever Night sweats Chills Loss of appetite Tuberculosis can also affect other parts of your body, including your kidneys, spine or brain",Tuberculosis
"When TB occurs outside your lungs, signs and symptoms vary according to the organs involved",Tuberculosis
"For example, tuberculosis of the spine may give you back pain, and tuberculosis in your kidneys might cause blood in your urine",Tuberculosis
"These are often signs of TB, but they can also result from other medical problems",Tuberculosis
"Your doctor can perform tests to help determine the cause",Tuberculosis
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people who have an increased risk of tuberculosis be screened for latent TB infection",Tuberculosis
"This can happen when someone with the untreated, active form of tuberculosis coughs, speaks, sneezes, spits, laughs or sings",Tuberculosis
"Although tuberculosis is contagious, it's not easy to catch",Tuberculosis
"You're much more likely to get tuberculosis from someone you live with or work with than from a stranger",Tuberculosis
"Most people with active TB who've had appropriate drug treatment for at least two weeks are no longer contagious",Tuberculosis
"HIV and TB Since the 1980s, the number of cases of tuberculosis has increased dramatically because of the spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS",Tuberculosis
"Infection with HIV suppresses the immune system, making it difficult for the body to control TB bacteria",Tuberculosis
"As a result, people with HIV are many times more likely to get TB and to progress from latent to active disease than are people who aren't HIV positive",Tuberculosis
"Drug-resistant TB Another reason tuberculosis remains a major killer is the increase in drug-resistant strains of the bacterium",Tuberculosis
"Since the first antibiotics were used to fight tuberculosis more than 60 years ago, some TB germs have developed the ability to survive, and that ability gets passed on to their descendants",Tuberculosis
"Drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis emerge when an antibiotic fails to kill all of the bacteria it targets",Tuberculosis
"The surviving bacteria become resistant to that particular drug and frequently other antibiotics as well",Tuberculosis
"Some TB bacteria have developed resistance to the most commonly used treatments, such as isoniazid and rifampin",Tuberculosis
"Some strains of TB have also developed resistance to drugs less commonly used in TB treatment, such as the antibiotics known as fluoroquinolones, and injectable medications including amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin",Tuberculosis
"These medications are often used to treat infections that are resistant to the more commonly used drugs",Tuberculosis
"These factors include: Weakened immune system A healthy immune system often successfully fights TB bacteria, but your body can't mount an effective defense if your resistance is low",Tuberculosis
"A number of diseases and medications can weaken your immune system, including: HIV/AIDS Diabetes Severe kidney disease Certain cancers Cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy Drugs to prevent rejection of transplanted organs Some drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and psoriasis Malnutrition Very young or advanced age Traveling or living in certain areas The risk of contracting tuberculosis is higher for people who live in or travel to countries that have high rates of tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis, including: Africa Eastern Europe Asia Russia Latin America Caribbean Islands Poverty and substance abuse Lack of medical care",Tuberculosis
"If you receive a low or fixed income, live in a remote area, have recently immigrated to the United States, or are homeless, you may lack access to the medical care needed to diagnose and treat TB",Tuberculosis
"Substance abuse",Tuberculosis
"IV drug use or alcohol abuse weakens your immune system and makes you more vulnerable to tuberculosis",Tuberculosis
"Using tobacco greatly increases the risk of getting TB and dying of it",Tuberculosis
"Where you work or live Health care work",Tuberculosis
"Regular contact with people who are ill increases your chances of exposure to TB bacteria",Tuberculosis
"Wearing a mask and frequent hand-washing greatly reduce your risk",Tuberculosis
"Living or working in a residential care facility",Tuberculosis
"People who live or work in prisons, immigration centers or nursing homes are all at a higher risk of tuberculosis",Tuberculosis
"That's because the risk of the disease is higher anywhere there is overcrowding and poor ventilation",Tuberculosis
"Living in a refugee camp or shelter",Tuberculosis
"Weakened by poor nutrition and ill health and living in crowded, unsanitary conditions, refugees are at especially high risk of tuberculosis infection",Tuberculosis
"Untreated active disease typically affects your lungs, but it can spread to other parts of your body through your bloodstream",Tuberculosis
"Examples of tuberculosis complications include:",Tuberculosis
"Migraine aura usually occurs within an hour before head pain begins and generally lasts less than 60 minutes",Migraine with aura
"Sometimes migraine aura occurs with little or no headache, especially in people age 50 and older",Migraine with aura
"Visual signs and symptoms Most people who experience migraine with aura develop temporary visual signs and symptoms of aura",Migraine with aura
"These may include: Blind spots (scotomas), which are sometimes outlined by simple geometric designs Zigzag lines that gradually float across your field of vision Shimmering spots or stars Changes in vision or vision loss Flashes of light These types of visual disturbances tend to start in the center of your field of vision and spread outward",Migraine with aura
"Your doctor will need to rule out more-serious conditions, such as a stroke or retinal tear",Migraine with aura
"Once these conditions are ruled out, you won't need to see your doctor about future migraines unless your symptoms change",Migraine with aura
"It's believed that the migraine with visual aura is like an electrical or chemical wave that moves across the part of your brain that processes visual signals (visual cortex) and causes these visual hallucinations",Migraine with aura
"Many of the same factors that trigger migraine can also trigger migraine with aura, including stress, bright lights, some foods and medications, too much or too little sleep, and menstruation",Migraine with aura
"Migraines are also more common in women than men",Migraine with aura
"Women who have migraine with aura appear to have an even higher risk of stroke if they smoke or take birth control pills",Migraine with aura

"The signs and symptoms of lupus that you experience will depend on which body systems are affected by the disease",Lupus
"Many conditions can cause these symptoms, so your doctor may check for these conditions as well as for pancreatic cancer",Pancreatic cancer
"Doctors have identified factors, such as smoking, that increase your risk of developing the disease",Pancreatic cancer
"Understanding your pancreas Your pancreas is about 6 inches (15 centimeters) long and looks something like a pear lying on its side",Pancreatic cancer
"It releases (secretes) hormones, including insulin, to help your body process sugar in the foods you eat",Pancreatic cancer
"And it produces digestive juices to help your body digest food",Pancreatic cancer
"How pancreatic cancer forms Pancreatic cancer occurs when cells in your pancreas develop mutations in their DNA",Pancreatic cancer
"These mutations cause cells to grow uncontrollably and to continue living after normal cells would die",Pancreatic cancer
"These accumulating cells can form a tumor",Pancreatic cancer
"Untreated pancreatic cancer spreads to nearby organs and blood vessels",Pancreatic cancer
"Most pancreatic cancer begins in the cells that line the ducts of the pancreas",Pancreatic cancer
"This type of cancer is called pancreatic adenocarcinoma or pancreatic exocrine cancer",Pancreatic cancer
"Rarely, cancer can form in the hormone-producing cells or the neuroendocrine cells of the pancreas",Pancreatic cancer
"These types of cancer are called islet cell tumors, pancreatic endocrine cancer and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors",Pancreatic cancer

"osteoarthritis The two main types of arthritis — osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis — damage joints in different ways",Arthritis
"Osteoarthritis The most common type of arthritis, osteoarthritis involves wear-and-tear damage to your joint's cartilage — the hard, slick coating on the ends of bones",Arthritis
"Enough damage can result in bone grinding directly on bone, which causes pain and restricted movement",Arthritis
"This wear and tear can occur over many years, or it can be hastened by a joint injury or infection",Arthritis
"Rheumatoid arthritis In rheumatoid arthritis, the body's immune system attacks the lining of the joint capsule, a tough membrane that encloses all the joint parts",Arthritis
"This lining, known as the synovial membrane, becomes inflamed and swollen",Arthritis
"The disease process can eventually destroy cartilage and bone within the joint",Arthritis
"Some types of arthritis run in families, so you may be more likely to develop arthritis if your parents or siblings have the disorder",Arthritis
"Your genes can make you more susceptible to environmental factors that may trigger arthritis",Arthritis
"The risk of many types of arthritis — including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout — increases with age",Arthritis
"Women are more likely than are men to develop rheumatoid arthritis, while most of the people who have gout, another type of arthritis, are men",Arthritis

"The throat end of the tubes open and close to: Regulate air pressure in the middle ear Refresh air in the ear Drain normal secretions from the middle ear Swelling, inflammation and mucus in the eustachian tubes from an upper respiratory infection or allergy can block them, causing the accumulation of fluids in the middle ear",Ear infections
"A bacterial or viral infection of this fluid is usually what produces the symptoms of an ear infection",Ear infections
"Ear infections are more common in children, in part, because their eustachian tubes are narrower and more horizontal — factors that make them more difficult to drain and more likely to get clogged",Ear infections
"Role of adenoids Adenoids are two small pads of tissues high in the back of the nose believed to play a role in immune system activity",Ear infections
"This function may make them particularly vulnerable to infection, inflammation and swelling",Ear infections
"Because adenoids are near the opening of the eustachian tubes, inflammation or enlargement of the adenoids may block the tubes, thereby contributing to middle ear infection",Ear infections
"Inflammation of adenoids is more likely to play a role in ear infections in children because children have relatively larger adenoids",Ear infections
"Related conditions Conditions of the middle ear that may be related to an ear infection or result in similar middle ear problems include the following: Otitis media with effusion is inflammation and fluid buildup (effusion) in the middle ear without bacterial or viral infection",Ear infections
"This may occur because the fluid buildup persists after an ear infection has resolved",Ear infections
"It may also occur because of some dysfunction or noninfectious blockage of the eustachian tubes",Ear infections
"is inflammation and fluid buildup (effusion) in the middle ear without bacterial or viral infection",Ear infections
"Chronic otitis media with effusion occurs when fluid remains in the middle ear and continues to return without bacterial or viral infection",Ear infections
"This makes children susceptible to new ear infections, and may affect hearing",Ear infections
"occurs when fluid remains in the middle ear and continues to return without bacterial or viral infection",Ear infections
"Chronic suppurative otitis media is a persistent ear infection that often results in tearing or perforation of the eardrum",Ear infections

"In most cases, the thyroid gland didn't develop normally for unknown reasons, but some children have an inherited form of the disorder",Hypothyroidism
"Often, infants with congenital hypothyroidism appear normal at birth",Hypothyroidism
"That's one reason why most states now require newborn thyroid screening",Hypothyroidism
"Pituitary disorder",Hypothyroidism
"A relatively rare cause of hypothyroidism is the failure of the pituitary gland to produce enough thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) — usually because of a benign tumor of the pituitary gland",Hypothyroidism
"Some women develop hypothyroidism during or after pregnancy (postpartum hypothyroidism), often because they produce antibodies to their own thyroid gland",Hypothyroidism
"Left untreated, hypothyroidism increases the risk of miscarriage, premature delivery and preeclampsia — a condition that causes a significant rise in a woman's blood pressure during the last three months of pregnancy",Hypothyroidism
"It can also seriously affect the developing fetus",Hypothyroidism

"With declining estrogen levels, you start to lose bone more quickly than you replace it, increasing your risk of osteoporosis — a disease that causes fragile bones",Perimenopause
"Changing cholesterol levels",Perimenopause
"Declining estrogen levels may lead to unfavorable changes in your blood cholesterol levels, including an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the bad cholesterol — which contributes to an increased risk of heart disease",Perimenopause
"At the same time, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol — the good cholesterol — decreases in many women as they age, which also increases the risk of heart disease",Perimenopause
"But others either tolerate the changes or simply don't experience symptoms severe enough to need attention",Perimenopause
"Because symptoms may be subtle and come on gradually, you may not realize at first that they're all connected to the same thing — rising and falling levels of estrogen and progesterone, another key female hormone",Perimenopause
"If you have symptoms that interfere with your life or well-being, such as hot flashes, mood swings or changes in sexual function that concern you, see your doctor",Perimenopause
"Many of the changes you experience during perimenopause are a result of decreasing estrogen",Perimenopause
"But it may occur earlier in some women than in others",Perimenopause
"Although not always conclusive, some evidence suggests that certain factors may make it more likely that you start perimenopause at an earlier age, including: Smoking",Perimenopause

"During the final month before birth, the space within the womb can become so crowded that the ball of the hip joint moves out of its proper position, which results in a shallower socket",Hip dysplasia
"The risk of hip dysplasia is also higher in babies born in the breech position or with foot deformities",Hip dysplasia
"This is called a hip labral tear",Hip dysplasia
"Hip dysplasia also can make the joint more likely to develop osteoarthritis",Hip dysplasia

"If you think you have shin splints but they don't get better with self-care, talk to your doctor",Chronic exertional compartment syndrome
"However, it's associated with increased pressure in a muscle compartment with exertion",Chronic exertional compartment syndrome
"When you exercise, increased blood flow to working muscles expands them",Chronic exertional compartment syndrome
"If the connective tissue (fascia) that binds the muscle fibers in a compartment doesn't also expand, pressure builds up in the compartment",Chronic exertional compartment syndrome
"Over time, the pressure cuts off some of the muscle's blood supply",Chronic exertional compartment syndrome
"Some experts suggest that how you move (biomechanics) might have a role in causing chronic exertional compartment syndrome",Chronic exertional compartment syndrome
"Other causes might include having enlarged muscles, an especially thick or inelastic band of tissue (fascia) surrounding a section of muscle, or high pressure within your veins (venous hypertension)",Chronic exertional compartment syndrome

"Pulmonary atresia symptoms may show up within hours to several days",Pulmonary atresia
"However, if your baby has any symptoms of pulmonary atresia after you've returned home, seek emergency medical attention",Pulmonary atresia
"It's thought that the problems that cause pulmonary atresia begin early in the pregnancy",Pulmonary atresia
"To understand the problems pulmonary atresia causes, it's helpful to know how the heart works",Pulmonary atresia
"How the heart works The heart is divided into four hollow chambers, two on the right and two on the left",Pulmonary atresia
"The right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs through vessels called pulmonary arteries",Pulmonary atresia
"In the lungs, blood picks up oxygen then returns to the heart's left side through the pulmonary veins",Pulmonary atresia
"The left side of the heart then pumps the blood through the aorta and out to the rest of the body to supply your baby's body with oxygen",Pulmonary atresia
"Blood moves through your baby's heart in one direction through valves that open and close as the heart beats",Pulmonary atresia
"The valve that allows blood out of your baby's heart and into the lungs to pick up oxygen is called the pulmonary valve",Pulmonary atresia
"In pulmonary atresia, the pulmonary valve doesn't develop properly, preventing it from opening",Pulmonary atresia
"Blood can't flow from the right ventricle to the lungs",Pulmonary atresia
"Before birth, the improperly formed valve isn't life-threatening, because the placenta provides oxygen for your baby instead of the lungs",Pulmonary atresia
"Blood entering the right side of your baby's heart passes through a hole (foramen ovale) between the top chambers of your baby's heart, so the oxygen-rich blood can be pumped out to the rest of your baby's body through the aorta",Pulmonary atresia
"After birth, your baby's lungs must provide oxygen for his or her body",Pulmonary atresia
"In pulmonary atresia, without a working pulmonary valve, blood must find another route to reach your baby's lungs",Pulmonary atresia
"The foramen ovale usually shuts soon after birth, but may stay open in pulmonary atresia",Pulmonary atresia
"Newborn babies also have a temporary connection (ductus arteriosus) between the aorta and the pulmonary artery",Pulmonary atresia
"This passage allows some of the oxygen-poor blood to travel to the lungs where it can pick up oxygen to supply your baby's body",Pulmonary atresia
"The ductus arteriosus normally closes within a few hours or days after birth, but can be kept open with medications",Pulmonary atresia
"In some cases, there may be a second hole in the tissue that separates the main pumping chambers of your baby's heart, called a ventricular septal defect (VSD)",Pulmonary atresia
"The VSD allows a pathway for blood to pass through the right ventricle into the left ventricle",Pulmonary atresia
"Children with pulmonary atresia and a VSD often have additional abnormalities of the lungs and the arteries that bring blood to the lungs",Pulmonary atresia
"If there's no VSD, the right ventricle receives little blood flow before birth and often doesn't develop fully",Pulmonary atresia
"This is a condition called pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS)",Pulmonary atresia
"Even after surgical repairs, you'll need to carefully monitor your child's health for any changes that could signal a problem",Pulmonary atresia
"People with structural heart problems, such as pulmonary atresia, are at a higher risk of infectious endocarditis than the general population",Pulmonary atresia
"Infectious endocarditis is an inflammation of the valves and inner lining of the heart caused by a bacterial infection",Pulmonary atresia
"Body odor also can vary from person to person",Sweating and body odor
"Eccrine glands occur over most of your body and open directly onto the surface of the skin",Sweating and body odor
"Apocrine glands develop in areas abundant in hair follicles, such as your armpits and groin, and they empty into the hair follicle just before it opens onto the skin surface",Sweating and body odor
"When your body temperature rises, your eccrine glands secrete fluid onto the surface of your skin, where it cools your body as it evaporates",Sweating and body odor
"This fluid is composed mainly of water and salt",Sweating and body odor
"Apocrine glands produce a milky fluid that most commonly is secreted when you're under emotional stress",Sweating and body odor
"This fluid is odorless until it combines with bacteria found normally on your skin",Sweating and body odor
"Many infants will also have an ear infection (otitis media)",Bronchiolitis
"This is especially important if your child is younger than 12 weeks old or has other risk factors for bronchiolitis — including premature birth or a heart or lung condition",Bronchiolitis
"The infection makes the bronchioles swell and become inflamed",Bronchiolitis
"Mucus collects in these airways, which makes it difficult for air to flow freely in and out of the lungs",Bronchiolitis
"Most cases of bronchiolitis are caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)",Bronchiolitis
"RSV is a common virus that infects just about every child by the age of 2",Bronchiolitis
"Outbreaks of the RSV infection occur every winter",Bronchiolitis
"Bronchiolitis can also be caused by other viruses, including those that cause the flu or the common cold",Bronchiolitis
"Infants can be reinfected with RSV because at least two strains exist",Bronchiolitis
"The viruses that cause bronchiolitis are easily spread",Bronchiolitis
"You can contract them through droplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks",Bronchiolitis
"You can also get them by touching shared objects — such as utensils, towels or toys — and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth",Bronchiolitis

"This can happen if: Your body doesn't make enough red blood cells Bleeding causes you to lose red blood cells more quickly than they can be replaced Your body destroys red blood cells What red blood cells do Your body makes three types of blood cells — white blood cells to fight infection, platelets to help your blood clot and red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout your body",Anemia
"Red blood cells contain hemoglobin — an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color",Anemia
"Hemoglobin enables red blood cells to carry oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body and to carry carbon dioxide from other parts of the body to your lungs so that it can be exhaled",Anemia
"Most blood cells, including red blood cells, are produced regularly in your bone marrow — a spongy material found within the cavities of many of your large bones",Anemia

"It is also caused by blood loss, such as from heavy menstrual bleeding, an ulcer, cancer and regular use of some over-the-counter pain relievers, especially aspirin",Anemia
"Vitamin deficiency anemia",Anemia
"In addition to iron, your body needs folate and vitamin B-12 to produce enough healthy red blood cells",Anemia
"A diet lacking in these and other key nutrients can cause decreased red blood cell production",Anemia
"Additionally, some people may consume enough B-12, but their bodies aren't able to process the vitamin",Anemia
"This can lead to vitamin deficiency anemia, also known as pernicious anemia",Anemia

"Certain blood diseases increase red blood cell destruction",Anemia
"You can inherit a hemolytic anemia, or you can develop it later in life",Anemia
"Sickle cell anemia",Anemia
"This inherited and sometimes serious condition is an inherited hemolytic anemia",Anemia
"It's caused by a defective form of hemoglobin that forces red blood cells to assume an abnormal crescent (sickle) shape",Anemia
"These irregular blood cells die prematurely, resulting in a chronic shortage of red blood cells",Anemia
"Other anemias",Anemia
"There are several other forms of anemia, such as thalassemia and malarial anemia",Anemia
"Having a diet that is consistently low in iron, vitamin B-12 and folate increases your risk of anemia",Anemia
"Intestinal disorders",Anemia
"Having an intestinal disorder that affects the absorption of nutrients in your small intestine — such as Crohn's disease and celiac disease — puts you at risk of anemia",Anemia
"Menstruation",Anemia
"In general, women who haven't experienced menopause have a greater risk of iron deficiency anemia than do men and postmenopausal women",Anemia

"Only about 1 in 10 infected people develops more-serious signs and symptoms of cholera, usually within a few days of infection",Cholera
"Cholera-related diarrhea comes on suddenly and may quickly cause dangerous fluid loss — as much as a quart (about 1 liter) an hour",Cholera
"Diarrhea due to cholera often has a pale, milky appearance that resembles water in which rice has been rinsed (rice-water stool)",Cholera
"Nausea and vomiting",Cholera
"Occurring especially in the early stages of cholera, vomiting may persist for hours at a time",Cholera
"Dehydration can develop within hours after the onset of cholera symptoms",Cholera
"Depending on how many body fluids have been lost, dehydration can range from mild to severe",Cholera
"A loss of 10 percent or more of total body weight indicates severe dehydration",Cholera
"Signs and symptoms of cholera dehydration include irritability, lethargy, sunken eyes, a dry mouth, extreme thirst, dry and shriveled skin that's slow to bounce back when pinched into a fold, little or no urine output, low blood pressure, and an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)",Cholera
"Dehydration may lead to a rapid loss of minerals in your blood (electrolytes) that maintain the balance of fluids in your body",Cholera
"This is called an electrolyte imbalance",Cholera
"Electrolyte imbalance An electrolyte imbalance can lead to serious signs and symptoms such as: Muscle cramps",Cholera
"These result from the rapid loss of salts such as sodium, chloride and potassium",Cholera
"Shock",Cholera
"This is one of the most serious complications of dehydration",Cholera
"It occurs when low blood volume causes a drop in blood pressure and a drop in the amount of oxygen in your body",Cholera
"If untreated, severe hypovolemic shock can cause death in a matter of minutes",Cholera
"Still, sporadic cases of cholera occur throughout the world",Cholera
"If you develop severe diarrhea after visiting an area with active cholera, see your doctor",Cholera
"If you have diarrhea, especially severe diarrhea, and think you may have been exposed to cholera, seek treatment right away",Cholera
"Severe dehydration is a medical emergency that requires immediate care regardless of the cause",Cholera
"However, the deadly effects of the disease are the result of a potent toxin called CTX that the bacterium produce in the small intestine",Cholera
"CTX binds to the intestinal walls, where it interferes with the normal flow of sodium and chloride",Cholera
"This causes the body to secrete enormous amounts of water, leading to diarrhea and a rapid loss of fluids and salts (electrolytes)",Cholera
"Contaminated water supplies are the main source of cholera infection, although raw shellfish, uncooked fruits and vegetables, and other foods also can harbor V",Cholera
"cholerae",Cholera
"Cholera bacteria have two distinct life cycles — one in the environment and one in humans",Cholera
"Cholera bacteria in the environment Cholera bacteria occur naturally in coastal waters, where they attach to tiny crustaceans called copepods",Cholera
"The cholera bacteria travel with their hosts, spreading worldwide as the crustaceans follow their food source — certain types of algae and plankton that grow explosively when water temperatures rise",Cholera
"Algae growth is further fueled by the urea found in sewage and in agricultural runoff",Cholera
"Cholera bacteria in people When humans ingest cholera bacteria, they may not become sick themselves, but they still pass the bacteria in their stool",Cholera
"When human feces contaminate food and water supplies, both can serve as ideal breeding grounds for the cholera bacteria",Cholera
"Because more than a million cholera bacteria — approximately the amount you'd find in a glass of contaminated water — are needed to cause illness, cholera usually isn't transmitted through casual person-to-person contact",Cholera
"The most common sources of cholera infection are standing water and certain types of food, including seafood, raw fruits and vegetables, and grains",Cholera
"Surface or well water",Cholera
"Cholera bacteria can lie dormant in water for long periods, and contaminated public wells are frequent sources of large-scale cholera outbreaks",Cholera
"People living in crowded conditions without adequate sanitation are especially at risk of cholera",Cholera
"Seafood",Cholera
"Eating raw or undercooked seafood, especially shellfish, that originates from certain locations can expose you to cholera bacteria",Cholera
"Most recent cases of cholera occurring in the United States have been traced to seafood from the Gulf of Mexico",Cholera
"Raw fruits and vegetables",Cholera
"Raw, unpeeled fruits and vegetables are a frequent source of cholera infection in areas where cholera is endemic",Cholera
"In developing nations, uncomposted manure fertilizers or irrigation water containing raw sewage can contaminate produce in the field",Cholera
"Grains",Cholera
"In regions where cholera is widespread, grains such as rice and millet that are contaminated after cooking and allowed to remain at room temperature for several hours become a medium for the growth of cholera bacteria",Cholera
"Still, certain factors can make you more vulnerable to the disease or more likely to experience severe signs and symptoms",Cholera
"Cholera is more likely to flourish in situations where a sanitary environment — including a safe water supply — is difficult to maintain",Cholera
"Such conditions are common to refugee camps, impoverished countries, and areas devastated by famine, war or natural disasters",Cholera
"Reduced or nonexistent stomach acid (hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria)",Cholera
"Cholera bacteria can't survive in an acidic environment, and ordinary stomach acid often serves as a first line defense against infection",Cholera
"But people with low levels of stomach acid — such as children, older adults, and people who take antacids, H-2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors — lack this protection, so they're at greater risk of cholera",Cholera
"Household exposure",Cholera
"You're at significantly increased risk of cholera if you live with someone who has the disease",Cholera
"Type O blood",Cholera
"For reasons that aren't entirely clear, people with type O blood are twice as likely to develop cholera compared with people with other blood types",Cholera
"Raw or undercooked shellfish",Cholera
"Although large-scale cholera outbreaks no longer occur in industrialized nations, eating shellfish from waters known to harbor the bacteria greatly increases your risk",Cholera
"In the most severe cases, the rapid loss of large amounts of fluids and electrolytes can lead to death within two to three hours",Cholera
"In less extreme situations, people who don't receive treatment may die of dehydration and shock hours to days after cholera symptoms first appear",Cholera
"Although shock and severe dehydration are the most devastating complications of cholera, other problems can occur, such as:",Cholera
"They most often appear for the first time in people in their teens or 20s",Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome

"Otherwise, little is known about why the extra pathway develops",Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
"WPW is more common in males than in females",Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
"Normal heartbeat Normal heartbeat Normal heart electrical system Your heart is made up of four chambers — two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles)",Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
"The rhythm of your heart is normally controlled by a mass of tissue in the right atrium (sinus node)",Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
"The sinus node produces electrical impulses that generate each heartbeat",Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
"These electrical impulses travel across the atria, causing muscle contractions that pump blood into the ventricles",Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
"The AV node slows the electrical signal before sending it to the ventricles",Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
"When electrical impulses reach the ventricles, muscle contractions pump blood to the lungs and the rest of the body",Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
"Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome Abnormal electrical system in WPW In WPW syndrome, an extra electrical pathway connects the atria and ventricles, allowing electrical impulses to bypass the AV node",Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
"When the electrical impulses use this detour through the heart, the ventricles are activated too early",Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
"The extra electrical pathway can cause two major types of rhythm disturbances: Looped electrical impulses",Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
"In WPW, the heart's electrical impulses travel down either the normal or the extra pathway and up the other one, creating a complete electrical loop of signals",Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
"This condition (AV reentrant tachycardia) sends impulses to the ventricles at a very rapid rate",Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
"As a result, the ventricles pump very quickly, causing rapid heartbeat",Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
"Disorganized electrical impulses",Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
"If electrical impulses don't begin correctly in the right atrium, they may travel across the atria in a disorganized way, causing atrial fibrillation",Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
"The disorganized signals and the extra pathway of WPW also can cause the ventricles to beat faster",Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
"As a result, the ventricles don't have time to fill with blood and don't pump enough blood to the body",Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
"But complications can occur, and it's not always possible to know your risk of serious heart-related events",Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome

"The local embassy or consulate may be able to help you find a well-regarded medical professional who speaks your language",Traveler's diarrhea
"Be especially cautious with children because traveler's diarrhea can cause severe dehydration in a short time",Traveler's diarrhea
"But almost always an infectious agent is to blame",Traveler's diarrhea
"You typically develop traveler's diarrhea after ingesting food or water that's contaminated with organisms from feces",Traveler's diarrhea
"These organisms are infectious agents — including various bacteria, viruses and parasites — that enter your digestive tract and overpower your defense mechanisms, resulting in signs and symptoms of traveler's diarrhea",Traveler's diarrhea
"The most common cause of traveler's diarrhea is enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) bacteria",Traveler's diarrhea
"These bacteria attach themselves to the lining of your intestine and release a toxin that causes diarrhea and abdominal cramps",Traveler's diarrhea
"So why aren't natives of high-risk countries affected in the same way? Often their bodies have become accustomed to the bacteria and have developed immunity to them",Traveler's diarrhea
"High-risk destinations for traveler's diarrhea include many areas of Central and South America, Mexico, Africa, the Middle East and most of Asia",Traveler's diarrhea
"Traveling to Eastern Europe and a few Caribbean islands also poses some risk",Traveler's diarrhea
"However, your risk of traveler's diarrhea is generally low in Northern and Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States",Traveler's diarrhea
"Your chances of getting traveler's diarrhea are mostly determined by your destination",Traveler's diarrhea
"But certain groups of people have a greater risk of developing the condition",Traveler's diarrhea
"These include: Young adults",Traveler's diarrhea
"The condition is slightly more common in young adult tourists",Traveler's diarrhea
"Though the reasons why aren't clear, it's possible that young adults lack acquired immunity",Traveler's diarrhea
"They may also be more adventurous than older people in their travels and dietary choices, or they may be less vigilant in avoiding contaminated foods",Traveler's diarrhea
"People with weakened immune systems",Traveler's diarrhea
"A weakened immune system increases vulnerability to infections",Traveler's diarrhea
"People with diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease or cirrhosis of the liver",Traveler's diarrhea
"These conditions can leave you more prone to infection or increase your risk of a more-severe infection",Traveler's diarrhea
"People who take acid blockers or antacids",Traveler's diarrhea
"Acid in the stomach tends to destroy organisms, so a reduction in stomach acid may leave more opportunity for bacterial survival",Traveler's diarrhea
"People who travel during certain seasons",Traveler's diarrhea
"The risk of traveler's diarrhea varies by season in certain parts of the world",Traveler's diarrhea
"For example, risk is highest in South Asia during the hot months just before the monsoons",Traveler's diarrhea
"Dehydration is especially dangerous for children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems",Traveler's diarrhea
"Dehydration caused by diarrhea can cause serious complications, including organ damage, shock or coma",Traveler's diarrhea
"Signs and symptoms of dehydration include a very dry mouth, intense thirst, little or no urination, and extreme weakness",Traveler's diarrhea
"But the disease progresses slowly, and the more painful symptoms may not emerge until adulthood",Trachoma
"The World Health Organization has identified five stages in the development of trachoma: Inflammation — follicular",Trachoma
"The infection is just beginning in this stage",Trachoma
"Five or more follicles — small bumps that contain lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell — are visible with magnification on the inner surface of your upper eyelid (conjunctiva)",Trachoma
"Inflammation — intense",Trachoma
"In this stage, your eye is now highly infectious and becomes irritated, with a thickening or swelling of the upper eyelid",Trachoma
"Eyelid scarring",Trachoma
"Repeated infections lead to scarring of the inner eyelid",Trachoma
"The scars often appear as white lines when examined with magnification",Trachoma
"Your eyelid may become distorted and may turn in (entropion)",Trachoma
"Ingrown eyelashes (trichiasis)",Trachoma
"The scarred inner lining of your eyelid continues to deform, causing your lashes to turn in so that they rub on and scratch the transparent outer surface of your eye (cornea)",Trachoma
"Corneal clouding",Trachoma
"The cornea becomes affected by an inflammation that is most commonly seen under your upper lid",Trachoma
"Continual inflammation compounded by scratching from the in-turned lashes leads to clouding of the cornea",Trachoma
"All the signs of trachoma are more severe in your upper lid than in your lower lid",Trachoma
"With advanced scarring, your upper lid may show a thick line",Trachoma
"In addition, the lubricating glandular tissue in your lids — including the tear-producing glands (lacrimal glands) — can be affected",Trachoma
"This can lead to extreme dryness, aggravating the problem even more",Trachoma
"Trachoma is a contagious condition",Trachoma
"Treating it as soon as possible helps prevent further infections",Trachoma
"Even if you haven't previously been diagnosed with a heart defect, symptoms such as cyanosis and shortness of breath are signals that you have a health problem that needs medical attention",Eisenmenger syndrome
"To understand how Eisenmenger syndrome affects your heart and lungs, it's helpful to know how your heart works",Eisenmenger syndrome
"How the heart works Your heart is divided into four chambers, two on the right and two on the left",Eisenmenger syndrome
"In performing its basic job — pumping blood throughout your body — your heart uses its left and right sides for different tasks",Eisenmenger syndrome
"The right side moves blood into vessels that lead to your lungs",Eisenmenger syndrome
"In your lungs, oxygen enriches your blood, which circulates to your heart's left side",Eisenmenger syndrome
"The left side of your heart pumps blood into a large vessel called the aorta, which circulates blood to the rest of your body",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Valves control the flow of blood into and out of the chambers of your heart",Eisenmenger syndrome
"These valves open to allow blood to move to the next chamber or to one of the arteries, and they close to keep blood from flowing backward",Eisenmenger syndrome
"How Eisenmenger syndrome develops For most people who have Eisenmenger syndrome, the cause of their condition is due to a hole (shunt) between the main blood vessels or chambers of your heart",Eisenmenger syndrome
"This shunt is a heart defect you're born with (congenital)",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Heart defects that can cause Eisenmenger syndrome include: Ventricular septal defect",Eisenmenger syndrome
"This shunt in the wall of tissue that divides the right and left sides of your heart's main pumping chambers (ventricles) is the most common cause of Eisenmenger syndrome",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Atrial septal defect",Eisenmenger syndrome
"An atrial septal defect is a shunt in the wall of tissue that divides the right and left sides of the upper chambers of your heart (atria)",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Patent ductus arteriosus",Eisenmenger syndrome
"This heart defect is an opening between the pulmonary artery that carries oxygen-poor blood to the lungs and the artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to the rest of your body (aorta)",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Atrioventricular canal defect",Eisenmenger syndrome
"In this heart defect, there's a large hole in the center of the heart where the walls between the upper chambers (atria) and lower chambers (ventricles) meet",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Some of the valves in your heart also may not function properly",Eisenmenger syndrome
"For each of these defects, the increased pressure of blood flowing through the shunt increases the pressure in your pulmonary artery",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Over time, this increased pressure damages the smaller blood vessels in your lungs",Eisenmenger syndrome
"The damaged blood vessel walls make it difficult for the red blood cells to take up oxygen",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Eisenmenger syndrome occurs when blood flows backward through the shunt, causing oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood to mix",Eisenmenger syndrome
"This lowers the oxygen level in your blood (cyanosis), and your red blood cell count increases to try to make up for the lack of oxygen",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Eisenmenger syndrome occurs when a congenital heart defect is not detected early enough to be treated before damage to the lung arteries occurs",Eisenmenger syndrome
"If you or your child receives a diagnosis of a heart defect, it's important to start treatment promptly, including having surgeries or procedures to help correct the defect",Eisenmenger syndrome
"A family history of heart defects also increases the risk of a baby developing a congenital heart defect, including the possibility of developing Eisenmenger syndrome",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Talk to your doctor about screening other family members for heart defects if you've been diagnosed with a heart defect or Eisenmenger syndrome",Eisenmenger syndrome
"The reversed blood flow through your heart lowers the amount of oxygen your body's tissues and organs receive",Eisenmenger syndrome
"This causes you to have a lower tolerance for physical activity and your skin to have a bluish or a grayish color",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Cyanosis will worsen over time",Eisenmenger syndrome
"High red blood cell count (erythrocytosis)",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Because you aren't getting enough oxygen-rich blood circulating throughout your body, your kidneys release a hormone that increases your number of red blood cells, the cells that carry oxygen throughout your body",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Having too many red blood cells can reduce the blood flow to other organs and increase your risk of developing blood clots",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Arrhythmias",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Enlargement and thickening of the walls in the heart, along with low oxygen levels, may cause an irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia)",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Some types of arrhythmias can cause blood to pool in your heart's chambers, where it can clot",Eisenmenger syndrome
"If the clot travels out of your heart and blocks an artery, you can have a heart attack or stroke",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Sudden cardiac arrest",Eisenmenger syndrome
"If you develop an arrhythmia as a complication of Eisenmenger syndrome, it's possible the arrhythmia could suddenly stop your heartbeat",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Sudden cardiac arrest is the sudden, unexpected loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Without immediate medical attention, you can die of sudden cardiac arrest in minutes",Eisenmenger syndrome
"You can also go into cardiac arrest during surgical procedures, usually related to changes in blood pressure caused by anesthesia",Eisenmenger syndrome
"The increased pressure in your heart can cause your heart muscles to weaken, decreasing its pumping effectiveness",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Eventually, this can lead to heart failure",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Increased pressure in the lungs and problems with your blood caused by Eisenmenger syndrome can cause life-threatening bleeding into your lungs and airways, causing you to cough up blood and further lowering your blood oxygen level",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Bleeding can also occur in other parts of the body",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Stoke can occur when a blood clot travels from the right to left side of the heart without being filtered out by your lungs",Eisenmenger syndrome
"This blood clot may then block a blood vessel in the brain, leading to a stroke",Eisenmenger syndrome
"The high levels of red blood cells in Eisenmenger syndrome also increase your risk of blood clots and stroke",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Low oxygen levels in your blood may lead to problems with your kidneys",Eisenmenger syndrome
"This can also increase your risk of developing gout",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Pregnancy risks",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Due to the demands pregnancy puts on a mother's heart and lungs, women who have Eisenmenger syndrome shouldn't become pregnant",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Pregnancy for a woman who has Eisenmenger syndrome poses a high risk of death for both the mother and baby",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Eisenmenger syndrome is a life-threatening condition",Eisenmenger syndrome
"The prognosis for people diagnosed with Eisenmenger syndrome depends on the type of congenital heart defect and other medical conditions",Eisenmenger syndrome
"People who are diagnosed with Eisenmenger syndrome can survive as long as age 50 to 60 and sometimes longer",Eisenmenger syndrome
"Signs you may have with varicose veins include: Veins that are dark purple or blue in color Veins that appear twisted and bulging; often like cords on your legs When painful signs and symptoms occur, they may include: An achy or heavy feeling in your legs Burning, throbbing, muscle cramping and swelling in your lower legs Worsened pain after sitting or standing for a long time Itching around one or more of your veins Bleeding from varicose veins A painful cord in the vein with red discoloration of the skin Color changes, hardening of the vein, inflammation of the skin or skin ulcers near your ankle, which can mean you have a serious form of vascular disease that requires medical attention Spider veins are similar to varicose veins, but they're smaller",Varicose veins
"Spider veins are found closer to the skin's surface and are often red or blue",Varicose veins
"They occur on the legs, but can also be found on the face",Varicose veins
"Spider veins vary in size and often look like a spider's web",Varicose veins
"But if you're concerned about how your veins look and feel and self-care measures haven't stopped your condition from getting worse, see your doctor",Varicose veins
"Veins return blood from the rest of your body to your heart, so the blood can be recirculated",Varicose veins
"To return blood to your heart, the veins in your legs must work against gravity",Varicose veins
"Muscle contractions in your lower legs act as pumps, and elastic vein walls help blood return to your heart",Varicose veins
"Tiny valves in your veins open as blood flows toward your heart then close to stop blood from flowing backward",Varicose veins
"As you get older, your veins can lose elasticity, causing them to stretch",Varicose veins
"The valves in your veins may become weak, allowing blood that should be moving toward your heart to flow backward",Varicose veins
"Blood pools in your veins, and your veins enlarge and become varicose",Varicose veins
"The veins appear blue because they contain deoxygenated blood, which is in the process of being recirculated through the lungs",Varicose veins
"Some pregnant women develop varicose veins",Varicose veins
"Pregnancy increases the volume of blood in your body, but decreases the flow of blood from your legs to your pelvis",Varicose veins
"This circulatory change is designed to support the growing fetus, but it can produce an unfortunate side effect — enlarged veins in your legs",Varicose veins
"Varicose veins may surface for the first time or may worsen during late pregnancy, when your uterus exerts greater pressure on the veins in your legs",Varicose veins
"Changes in your hormones during pregnancy also may play a role",Varicose veins
"Varicose veins that develop during pregnancy generally improve without medical treatment three to 12 months after delivery",Varicose veins
"The risk of varicose veins increases with age",Varicose veins
"Aging causes wear and tear on the valves in your veins that help regulate blood flow",Varicose veins
"Eventually, that wear causes the valves to allow some blood to flow back into your veins where it collects instead of flowing up to your heart",Varicose veins
"Women are more likely to develop the condition",Varicose veins
"Hormonal changes during pregnancy, premenstruation or menopause may be a factor because female hormones tend to relax vein walls",Varicose veins
"Taking hormone replacement therapy or birth control pills may increase your risk of varicose veins",Varicose veins
"If other family members had varicose veins, there's a greater chance you will too",Varicose veins
"Being overweight puts added pressure on your veins",Varicose veins
"Standing or sitting for long periods of time",Varicose veins
"Your blood doesn't flow as well if you're in the same position for long periods",Varicose veins
"You can miss your period for a number of reasons — including pregnancy, stress, or a change in diet or exercise habits — but it's best to get evaluated whenever your menstrual cycle changes",Premature ovarian failure
"Even if you don't mind not having periods, it's advisable to see your doctor to find out what's causing the change",Premature ovarian failure
"Low estrogen levels can lead to bone loss",Premature ovarian failure
"Usually one or two follicles — tiny sacs filled with fluid — reach maturity each month",Premature ovarian failure
"When the follicle matures, it opens, releasing an egg",Premature ovarian failure
"The egg enters the fallopian tube where a sperm cell might fertilize it, resulting in pregnancy",Premature ovarian failure
"Premature ovarian failure results from the loss of eggs (oocytes)",Premature ovarian failure
"This might happen because of: Chromosomal defects",Premature ovarian failure
"Certain genetic disorders are associated with premature ovarian failure",Premature ovarian failure
"These include mosaic Turner's syndrome — in which a woman has only one normal X chromosome and an altered second X chromosome — and fragile X syndrome — in which the X chromosomes are fragile and break",Premature ovarian failure
"Toxins",Premature ovarian failure
"Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are the most common causes of toxin-induced ovarian failure",Premature ovarian failure
"These therapies can damage the genetic material in cells",Premature ovarian failure
"Other toxins such as cigarette smoke, chemicals, pesticides and viruses might hasten ovarian failure",Premature ovarian failure
"An immune system response to ovarian tissue (autoimmune disease)",Premature ovarian failure
"In this rare form, your immune system produces antibodies against your ovarian tissue, harming the egg-containing follicles and damaging the egg",Premature ovarian failure
"What triggers the immune response is unclear, but exposure to a virus is one possibility",Premature ovarian failure
"It's possible to develop premature ovarian failure, but have no known chromosomal defects, toxin exposure or autoimmune disease",Premature ovarian failure
"Your doctor might recommend further testing to find the cause, but in most cases, the cause remains unknown (idiopathic)",Premature ovarian failure
"Risk rises between the ages of 35 and 40, although younger women and adolescents can develop the condition",Premature ovarian failure
"Having a family history of premature ovarian failure increases your risk of developing this disorder",Premature ovarian failure
"Multiple ovarian surgeries",Premature ovarian failure
"Ovarian endometriosis or other conditions requiring repeated surgeries on the ovaries increases the risk of premature ovarian failure",Premature ovarian failure
"You may have infections that are more frequent, longer lasting or harder to treat than are the infections of someone with a normal immune system",Primary immunodeficiency
"You may also get infections that a person with a healthy immune system likely wouldn't get (opportunistic infections)",Primary immunodeficiency
"Signs and symptoms differ depending on the type of primary immunodeficiency disorder, and they vary from person to person",Primary immunodeficiency
"Early diagnosis and treatment of primary immune deficiencies may prevent infections that can cause long-term problems",Primary immunodeficiency
"During the incubation period of seven to 17 days, you look and feel healthy and can't infect others",Smallpox
"Following the incubation period, a sudden onset of flu-like signs and symptoms occurs",Smallpox
"These include: Fever Overall discomfort Headache Severe fatigue Severe back pain Vomiting, possibly A few days later, flat, red spots appear first on your face, hands and forearms, and later on your trunk",Smallpox
"Within a day or two, many of these lesions turn into small blisters filled with clear fluid, which then turns into pus",Smallpox
"Scabs begin to form eight to nine days later and eventually fall off, leaving deep, pitted scars",Smallpox
"Lesions also develop in the mucous membranes of your nose and mouth and quickly turn into sores that break open",Smallpox
"He or she may refer you to a doctor who specializes in congenital heart disease (cardiologist)",Ebstein's anomaly
"Why it occurs is still unknown",Ebstein's anomaly
"To understand how Ebstein's anomaly affects your heart, it helps to know a little about how the heart works to supply your body with blood",Ebstein's anomaly
"How your heart works Your heart is made up of four chambers",Ebstein's anomaly
"Four valves open and close to let blood flow in one direction through the heart",Ebstein's anomaly
"Each valve consists of two or three strong, thin flaps (leaflets) of tissue",Ebstein's anomaly
"When closed, a valve prevents blood from flowing to the next chamber or from returning to the previous chamber",Ebstein's anomaly
"Oxygen-poor blood returns from your body and flows into the right atrium",Ebstein's anomaly
"Blood then flows through the tricuspid valve and into the right ventricle, which pumps the blood to your lungs to receive oxygen",Ebstein's anomaly
"On the other side of your heart, oxygen-rich blood from your lungs flows into the left atrium, through the mitral valve and into the left ventricle, which then pumps the blood to the rest of your body",Ebstein's anomaly
"Ebstein's anomaly Ebstein's anomaly What happens in Ebstein's anomaly In Ebstein's anomaly, the tricuspid valve sits lower than normal in the right ventricle",Ebstein's anomaly
"This makes it so that a portion of the right ventricle becomes part of the right atrium (becomes atrialized), causing the right atrium to be larger than usual",Ebstein's anomaly
"Because of this, the right ventricle can't work properly",Ebstein's anomaly
"Also, the tricuspid valve's leaflets are abnormally formed",Ebstein's anomaly
"This can lead to blood leaking backward into the right atrium (tricuspid valve regurgitation)",Ebstein's anomaly
"The placement of the valve and how poorly it's formed may vary among people",Ebstein's anomaly
"Some people may have a mildly abnormal valve",Ebstein's anomaly
"Others may have a valve that is extremely displaced, and it may leak severely",Ebstein's anomaly
"The more the tricuspid valve leaks, the more the right atrium enlarges as it receives more blood",Ebstein's anomaly
"At the same time, the right ventricle enlarges (dilates) as it tries to cope with the leaky valve and still deliver blood to the lungs",Ebstein's anomaly
"Thus, the right-sided chambers of the heart enlarge, and as they do, they weaken, which may lead to heart failure",Ebstein's anomaly
"Other heart conditions associated with Ebstein's anomaly Several other heart conditions may be associated with Ebstein's anomaly",Ebstein's anomaly
"A few common conditions include: Holes in the heart",Ebstein's anomaly
"Many people with Ebstein's anomaly have a hole between the two upper chambers of the heart called an atrial septal defect or a small flap-like opening called a patent foramen ovale (PFO)",Ebstein's anomaly
"A PFO is a hole between the upper heart chambers that is present in all babies before birth but usually closes after birth, although it may remain open in some people without causing issues",Ebstein's anomaly
"These holes may allow oxygen-poor blood in the right atrium to mix with oxygen-rich blood in the left atrium, decreasing the amount of oxygen available in your blood",Ebstein's anomaly
"This causes a bluish discoloration of the lips and skin (cyanosis)",Ebstein's anomaly
"Abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias)",Ebstein's anomaly
"Some people with Ebstein's anomaly have an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) characterized by rapid heartbeats (tachycardia)",Ebstein's anomaly
"These types of arrhythmias can make your heart work less effectively, especially when the tricuspid valve is leaking severely",Ebstein's anomaly
"In some cases, a very fast heart rhythm may cause fainting spells (syncope)",Ebstein's anomaly
"Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome",Ebstein's anomaly
"Some people with Ebstein's anomaly may also have a condition known as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome — an abnormal electrical pathway in the heart",Ebstein's anomaly
"The presence of WPW syndrome can lead to very fast heart rates and fainting spells",Ebstein's anomaly
"It's uncertain what risk factors might cause the defect",Ebstein's anomaly
"Genetic and environmental factors are both thought to play a role",Ebstein's anomaly
"People with a family history of heart defects may be more likely to have Ebstein's anomaly",Ebstein's anomaly
"A mother's exposure to certain medications, such as lithium, may be associated with Ebstein's anomaly in the child",Ebstein's anomaly
"However, you may need to take some precautions in certain situations: Being active",Ebstein's anomaly
"If you have mild Ebstein's anomaly with a nearly normal heart size and no heart rhythm disturbances, you can probably participate in most physical activities",Ebstein's anomaly
"Depending on your signs and symptoms, your doctor may recommend that you avoid certain competitive sports, such as football or basketball",Ebstein's anomaly
"Your doctor can help you decide which activities are right for you",Ebstein's anomaly
"During pregnancy",Ebstein's anomaly
"In many cases, women with mild Ebstein's anomaly can safely have children",Ebstein's anomaly
"But pregnancy does have risks",Ebstein's anomaly
"If you plan on becoming pregnant, be sure to talk to your doctor ahead of time",Ebstein's anomaly
"He or she can tell you if it's safe for you to become pregnant and help decide how much extra monitoring you may need throughout pregnancy and childbirth",Ebstein's anomaly
"He or she may also suggest other treatments for your condition or symptoms before you become pregnant",Ebstein's anomaly
"Being pregnant puts additional strain on your heart and circulatory system not only during pregnancy, but also during labor and delivery",Ebstein's anomaly
"However, vaginal delivery may be possible",Ebstein's anomaly
"Rarely, severe complications can develop that can cause death to the mother or baby",Ebstein's anomaly
"Other complications that may result from Ebstein's anomaly include heart failure, heart rhythm problems and, less commonly, sudden cardiac arrest or stroke",Ebstein's anomaly
"If you have a fever and swelling in your face and you can't reach your dentist, go to an emergency room",Tooth abscess
"Also go to the emergency room if you have trouble breathing or swallowing",Tooth abscess
"These symptoms may indicate that the infection has spread deeper into your jaw and surrounding tissue or even to other areas of your body",Tooth abscess
"Bacteria enter through either a dental cavity or a chip or crack in the tooth and spread all the way down to the root",Tooth abscess
"The bacterial infection can cause swelling and inflammation at the tip of the root",Tooth abscess
"Not taking proper care of your teeth and gums — such as not brushing your teeth twice a day and not flossing — can increase your risk of tooth decay, gum disease, tooth abscess, and other dental and mouth complications",Tooth abscess
"A diet high in sugar",Tooth abscess
"Frequently eating and drinking foods rich in sugar, such as sweets and sodas, can contribute to dental cavities and turn into a tooth abscess",Tooth abscess
"If the abscess ruptures, the pain may decrease significantly — but you still need dental treatment",Tooth abscess
"If the abscess doesn't drain, the infection may spread to your jaw and to other areas of your head and neck",Tooth abscess
"You might even develop sepsis — a life-threatening infection that spreads throughout your body",Tooth abscess
"If you have a weakened immune system and you leave a tooth abscess untreated, your risk of a spreading infection increases even more",Tooth abscess
"The main symptom of emphysema is shortness of breath, which usually begins gradually",Emphysema
"You may start avoiding activities that cause you to be short of breath, so the symptom doesn't become a problem until it starts interfering with daily tasks",Emphysema

"In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode",Epilepsy
"Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how the abnormal brain activity begins",Epilepsy
"Focal seizures When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they're called focal (partial) seizures",Epilepsy
"These seizures fall into two categories",Epilepsy
"Focal seizures without loss of consciousness (simple partial seizures)",Epilepsy

"The pituitary, a small gland situated at the base of your brain behind the bridge of your nose, produces a number of hormones",Acromegaly
"GH plays an important role in managing your physical growth",Acromegaly
"When GH is secreted into your bloodstream, it triggers your liver to produce a hormone called insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)",Acromegaly
"In turn, IGF-I stimulates the growth of bones and other tissues",Acromegaly
"If your pituitary gland makes too much GH, excessive amounts of IGF-I can result",Acromegaly
"Too much IGF-I can cause abnormal growth of your soft tissues and skeleton and other signs and symptoms characteristic of acromegaly and gigantism",Acromegaly
"In adults, a tumor is the most common cause of too much GH production: Pituitary tumors",Acromegaly
"Most cases of acromegaly are caused by a noncancerous (benign) tumor (adenoma) of the pituitary gland",Acromegaly
"The tumor secretes excessive amounts of growth hormone, causing many of the signs and symptoms of acromegaly",Acromegaly
"Some of the symptoms of acromegaly, such as headaches and impaired vision, are due to the tumor mass pressing on nearby brain tissues",Acromegaly
"Nonpituitary tumors",Acromegaly
"In a few people with acromegaly, tumors in other parts of the body, such as the lungs, pancreas or adrenal glands, cause the disorder",Acromegaly

"Excessive daytime drowsiness (hypersomnia) may be due to other disorders, such as narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea",Central sleep apnea
"Central sleep apnea can be caused by a number of conditions that affect the ability of your brainstem — which links your brain to your spinal cord and controls many functions such as heart rate and breathing — to control your breathing",Central sleep apnea
"The cause varies with the type of central sleep apnea you have",Central sleep apnea
"Types include: Cheyne-Stokes breathing",Central sleep apnea
"This type of central sleep apnea is most commonly associated with congestive heart failure or stroke",Central sleep apnea
"This condition is characterized by a gradual increase and then decrease in breathing effort and airflow",Central sleep apnea
"During the weakest breathing effort, a total lack of airflow (central sleep apnea) can occur",Central sleep apnea
"Drug-induced apnea",Central sleep apnea
"Taking certain medications such as opioids — including morphine sulfate (Ms Contin, others), oxycodone (Oxycodone HCL, Oxycontin, others) or codeine sulfate — may cause your breathing to become irregular, to increase and decrease in a regular pattern, or to temporarily stop completely",Central sleep apnea
"High-altitude periodic breathing",Central sleep apnea
"A Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern may occur if you're exposed to a very high altitude",Central sleep apnea
"The change in oxygen at this altitude is the reason for the alternating rapid breathing (hyperventilation) and underbreathing",Central sleep apnea
"Complex sleep apnea",Central sleep apnea
"Some people with obstructive sleep apnea develop central sleep apnea while using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for their sleep apnea treatment",Central sleep apnea
"This condition is known as complex sleep apnea because it's a combination of obstructive and central sleep apneas",Central sleep apnea
"Medical condition-induced central sleep apnea",Central sleep apnea
"Several medical conditions may give rise to central sleep apnea of the non-Cheyne-Stokes variety",Central sleep apnea
"Idiopathic (primary) central sleep apnea",Central sleep apnea
"The cause of this uncommon type of central sleep apnea isn't known",Central sleep apnea
"Males are more likely to develop central sleep apnea than are females",Central sleep apnea
"Central sleep apnea is more common among older adults, especially adults older than age 65, possibly because they may have other medical conditions or sleep patterns that are more likely to cause central sleep apnea",Central sleep apnea

"Other signs may include needing to get up at night to urinate (nocturia) and bed-wetting",Diabetes insipidus
"Normally, your kidneys remove excess body fluids from your bloodstream",Diabetes insipidus
"This fluid waste is temporarily stored in your bladder as urine, before you urinate",Diabetes insipidus
"When your fluid regulation system is working properly, your kidneys conserve fluid and make less urine when your body water is decreased, such as through perspiration",Diabetes insipidus
"The volume and composition of your body fluids remain balanced through a combination of oral intake and excretion by the kidneys",Diabetes insipidus
"The rate of fluid intake is largely governed by thirst, although your habits can increase your intake far above the amount necessary",Diabetes insipidus
"The rate of fluid excreted by your kidneys is greatly influenced by the production of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin",Diabetes insipidus
"Your body makes ADH in the hypothalamus and stores the hormone in your pituitary gland, a small gland located in the base of your brain",Diabetes insipidus
"ADH is released into your bloodstream when your body starts to become dehydrated",Diabetes insipidus
"ADH then concentrates the urine by triggering the kidney tubules to release water back into your bloodstream rather than excreting as much water into your urine",Diabetes insipidus
"The way in which your system is disrupted determines which form of diabetes insipidus you have: Central diabetes insipidus",Diabetes insipidus
"The cause of central diabetes insipidus in adults is usually damage to the pituitary gland or hypothalamus",Diabetes insipidus
"This damage disrupts the normal production, storage and release of ADH",Diabetes insipidus
"The damage is commonly due to surgery, a tumor, an illness (such as meningitis), inflammation or a head injury",Diabetes insipidus
"For children, the cause may be an inherited genetic disorder",Diabetes insipidus
"In some cases the cause is unknown",Diabetes insipidus
"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus",Diabetes insipidus
"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when there's a defect in the kidney tubules — the structures in your kidneys that cause water to be excreted or reabsorbed",Diabetes insipidus
"This defect makes your kidneys unable to properly respond to ADH",Diabetes insipidus
"The defect may be due to an inherited (genetic) disorder or a chronic kidney disorder",Diabetes insipidus
"Certain drugs, such as lithium or the antiviral medications cidofovir and foscarnet (Foscavir), also can cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus",Diabetes insipidus
"Gestational diabetes insipidus",Diabetes insipidus
"Gestational diabetes insipidus is rare and occurs only during pregnancy and when an enzyme made by the placenta — the system of blood vessels and other tissue that allows the exchange of nutrients and waste products between a mother and her baby — destroys ADH in the mother",Diabetes insipidus
"Primary polydipsia",Diabetes insipidus
"This condition — also known as dipsogenic diabetes insipidus or psychogenic polydipsia — can cause excretion of large volumes of dilute urine",Diabetes insipidus
"Rather than a problem with ADH production or damage, the underlying cause is intake of excessive fluids",Diabetes insipidus
"Prolonged excessive water intake by itself can damage the kidneys and suppress ADH, making your body unable to concentrate urine",Diabetes insipidus
"Primary polydipsia can be the result of abnormal thirst caused by damage to the thirst-regulating mechanism, situated in the hypothalamus",Diabetes insipidus
"Primary polydipsia has also been linked to mental illness",Diabetes insipidus

"When a mosquito bites a person infected with a Zika virus, the virus enters the mosquito",Zika virus infection
"When the infected mosquito then bites another person, the virus enters that person's bloodstream",Zika virus infection
"Spread of the virus through sexual contact and blood transfusion have been reported",Zika virus infection
"Being in tropical and subtropical areas increases your risk of exposure to the virus that causes Zika virus disease",Zika virus infection
"Especially high-risk areas include several islands of the Pacific region, a number of countries in Central, South and North America, and islands near West Africa",Zika virus infection

"It isn't clear what causes cervical cancer, but it's certain that HPV plays a role",Cervical cancer
"HPV is very common, and most women with the virus never develop cervical cancer",Cervical cancer
"This means other factors — such as your environment or your lifestyle choices — also determine whether you'll develop cervical cancer",Cervical cancer
"Types of cervical cancer The type of cervical cancer that you have helps determine your prognosis and treatment",Cervical cancer

"Wet macular degeneration can develop in different ways: Vision loss caused by abnormal blood vessel growth",Wet macular degeneration
"Sometimes abnormal new blood vessels grow from the choroid under and into the macula (choroidal neovascularization)",Wet macular degeneration
"The choroid is the layer of blood vessels between the retina and the outer, firm coat of the eye (sclera)",Wet macular degeneration
"These abnormal blood vessels may leak fluid or blood, interfering with the retina's function",Wet macular degeneration
"Vision loss caused by fluid buildup in the back of the eye",Wet macular degeneration

"There are two major types of congenital adrenal hyperplasia: Classic CAH",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"This more-severe form of the disease is usually detected in infancy",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"This more-severe form of the disease Nonclassic CAH",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"This milder and more common form may not become evident until childhood or early adulthood",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"Classic CAH Approximately two-thirds of people with classic CAH are classified as having the salt-losing form, while one-third have the simple-virilizing form",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"In both forms, affected females have genital ambiguity",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"A child with classic CAH may experience: A lack in the production of cortisol in both the salt-losing and simple-virilizing forms",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"Most of the problems caused by classic CAH are related to a lack of cortisol, which plays an important role in regulating your blood pressure, maintaining blood sugar and energy levels, and protecting your body against stress",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"A lack in the production of aldosterone in the salt-losing form",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"This can lead to low blood pressure, a lower sodium level and a higher potassium level",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"Sodium and potassium normally work together to help maintain the right balance of fluids in your body",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"Excess production of the male sex hormones (androgens such as testosterone)",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"This can result in short height, early puberty and in females, abnormal genital development while in the womb",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"Signs and symptoms of classic CAH in infants include: In females, enlarged clitoris or genitals that look more male than female (ambiguous genitalia) at birth, but males have normal appearing genitals Significant illness related to a lack of cortisol, aldosterone or both (adrenal crisis), which can be life-threatening Signs and symptoms of classic CAH in children and adults include: Very early appearance of pubic hair Rapid growth during childhood, but shorter than average final height Nonclassic CAH This form of CAH is milder than classic CAH",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"Often there are no symptoms at birth",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"The condition is not identified on routine infant blood screening and often only becomes evident in late childhood or early adulthood",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"Hormone deficiency may only involve cortisol levels",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"CAH may also be identified when male or female babies show signs of severe illness due to low levels of cortisol, aldosterone or both",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"In nonclassic CAH, you may notice signs and symptoms of early puberty in your toddler or child",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"In this case, or if you have concerns about your child's growth or development, make an appointment with your child's pediatrician",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"If you're pregnant and may be at risk of CAH because of your own medical history or your ethnicity, ask your doctor about genetic counseling",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"CAH may sometimes be called 21-hydroxylase deficiency",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"There are other much rarer enzyme deficiencies that also cause CAH",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"CAH is passed along in an inheritance pattern called autosomal recessive",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"Children who have the condition have two parents who either have CAH themselves or who are both carriers of the genetic mutation that causes the condition",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"People with classic CAH are at risk of experiencing adrenal crisis",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"This is caused by severely low levels of cortisol in the blood, resulting in diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, low blood sugar levels and shock",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"It's a life-threatening medical emergency that requires immediate treatment",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
"Impaired production of aldosterone may occur as well, leading to dehydration with low sodium and high potassium levels",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia

"Infertility",Endometriosis
"Endometriosis is first diagnosed in some women who are seeking treatment for infertility",Endometriosis
"Other symptoms",Endometriosis
"You may also experience fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, bloating or nausea, especially during menstrual periods",Endometriosis
"The severity of your pain isn't necessarily a reliable indicator of the extent of the condition",Endometriosis
"Some women with mild endometriosis have intense pain, while others with advanced endometriosis may have little pain or even no pain at all",Endometriosis
"Endometriosis is sometimes mistaken for other conditions that can cause pelvic pain, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or ovarian cysts",Endometriosis
"It may be confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a condition that causes bouts of diarrhea, constipation and abdominal cramping",Endometriosis
"IBS can accompany endometriosis, which can complicate the diagnosis",Endometriosis
"Endometriosis can be a challenging condition to manage",Endometriosis
"An early diagnosis, a multidisciplinary medical team and an understanding of your diagnosis may result in better management of your symptoms",Endometriosis
"In retrograde menstruation, menstrual blood containing endometrial cells flows back through the fallopian tubes and into the pelvic cavity instead of out of the body",Endometriosis
"These displaced endometrial cells stick to the pelvic walls and surfaces of pelvic organs, where they grow and continue to thicken and bleed over the course of each menstrual cycle",Endometriosis
"Transformation of peritoneal cells",Endometriosis
"In what's known as the induction theory, experts propose that hormones or immune factors promote transformation of peritoneal cells — cells that line the inner side of your abdomen — into endometrial cells",Endometriosis
"Embryonic cell transformation",Endometriosis
"Hormones such as estrogen may transform embryonic cells — cells in the earliest stages of development — into endometrial cell implants during puberty",Endometriosis
"Surgical scar implantation",Endometriosis
"After a surgery, such as a hysterectomy or C-section, endometrial cells may attach to a surgical incision",Endometriosis
"Endometrial cells transport",Endometriosis
"The blood vessels or tissue fluid (lymphatic) system may transport endometrial cells to other parts of the body",Endometriosis
"Immune system disorder",Endometriosis
"It's possible that a problem with the immune system may make the body unable to recognize and destroy endometrial tissue that's growing outside the uterus",Endometriosis
"Transcript In preparation for ovulation, the lining of the uterus, or endometrium, thickens",Endometriosis
"If fertilization does not occur, the uterus sheds its lining through the vagina",Endometriosis
"In endometriosis, the endometrium grows outside of the uterus",Endometriosis
"One cause of this growth may be retrograde menstruation",Endometriosis
"During retrograde menstruation, menstrual fluid flows backward into the fallopian tubes instead of leaving the body through the vagina",Endometriosis
"Because the fallopian tubes are open-ended, menstrual backflow can spill into the pelvic cavity",Endometriosis
"Backflow of menstrual fluid may promote the transfer of clumped endometrial cells to other tissues in the pelvis",Endometriosis
"Or menstrual fluid in the pelvic cavity could transform parts of those tissues into endometrial cells",Endometriosis
"In either process, clumps of endometrium may start to grow on the tissues lining your pelvic cavity, as well as on your fallopian tubes, ovaries and large intestine",Endometriosis
"This growth continues to act as it normally would during a menstrual cycle",Endometriosis
"It thickens, breaks down and bleeds each month",Endometriosis
"Because there's nowhere for the blood from this displaced tissue to exit your body, it becomes trapped",Endometriosis
"Trapped blood may lead to cysts, scar tissue and adhesions, abnormal tissue that binds organs together",Endometriosis
"Scarring from endometriosis can block your fallopian tubes",Endometriosis
"Blocked tubes may keep sperm cells from reaching and fertilizing the egg, causing fertility problems",Endometriosis
"The menstrual fluid could alter some types of cells in the pelvic cavity to change their structure, or clumps of endometrial tissue contained in the menstrual fluid could stick to the tissues it lands on and start to grow",Endometriosis
"In either case, this may be a factor in causing endometriosis",Endometriosis
"Signs and symptoms of endometriosis end temporarily with pregnancy and end permanently with menopause, unless you're taking estrogen",Endometriosis
"Approximately one-third to one-half of women with endometriosis have difficulty getting pregnant",Endometriosis
"For pregnancy to occur, an egg must be released from an ovary, travel through the neighboring fallopian tube, become fertilized by a sperm cell and attach itself to the uterine wall to begin development",Endometriosis
"Endometriosis may obstruct the tube and keep the egg and sperm from uniting",Endometriosis
"But the condition also seems to affect fertility in less-direct ways, such as damage to the sperm or egg",Endometriosis
"Even so, many women with mild to moderate endometriosis can still conceive and carry a pregnancy to term",Endometriosis
"Doctors sometimes advise women with endometriosis not to delay having children because the condition may worsen with time",Endometriosis
"Ovarian cancer Ovarian cancer does occur at higher than expected rates in women with endometriosis",Endometriosis
"But the overall lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is low to begin with",Endometriosis
"Some studies suggest that endometriosis increases that risk, but it's still relatively low",Endometriosis
"Although rare, another type of cancer — endometriosis-associated adenocarcinoma — can develop later in life in women who have had endometriosis",Endometriosis
"Primary brain tumors begin when normal cells acquire errors (mutations) in their DNA",Brain tumor
"These mutations allow cells to grow and divide at increased rates and to continue living when healthy cells would die",Brain tumor

"A medulloblastoma starts in the lower back part of the brain and tends to spread through the spinal fluid",Brain tumor
"These tumors are less common in adults, but they do occur",Brain tumor
"PNETs",Brain tumor
"Primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) are rare, cancerous tumors that start in embryonic (fetal) cells in the brain",Brain tumor
"They can occur anywhere in the brain",Brain tumor
"Germ cell tumors",Brain tumor
"Germ cell tumors may develop during childhood where the testicles or ovaries will form",Brain tumor
"But sometimes germ cell tumors move to other parts of the body, such as the brain",Brain tumor
"Craniopharyngiomas",Brain tumor
"These rare, noncancerous tumors start near the brain's pituitary gland, which secretes hormones that control many body functions",Brain tumor
"As the craniopharyngioma slowly grows, it can affect the pituitary gland and other structures near the brain",Brain tumor
"Cancer that begins elsewhere and spreads to the brain Secondary (metastatic) brain tumors are tumors that result from cancer that starts elsewhere in your body and then spreads (metastasizes) to your brain",Brain tumor
"Secondary brain tumors most often occur in people who have a history of cancer",Brain tumor
"But in rare cases, a metastatic brain tumor may be the first sign of cancer that began elsewhere in your body",Brain tumor
"Secondary brain tumors are far more common than are primary brain tumors",Brain tumor
"But doctors have identified some factors that may increase your risk of a brain tumor",Brain tumor
"When you're young, your body makes new bone faster than it breaks down old bone and your bone mass increases",Osteoporosis

"Hormone levels Osteoporosis is more common in people who have too much or too little of certain hormones in their bodies",Osteoporosis
"Examples include: Sex hormones",Osteoporosis
"Lowered sex hormone levels tend to weaken bone",Osteoporosis
"The reduction of estrogen levels in women at menopause is one of the strongest risk factors for developing osteoporosis",Osteoporosis

"The rash appears in people who have developed sensitivity to components of sunlight, and in particular ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or other sources, such as tanning beds or tanning lamps",Polymorphous light eruption
"This sensitivity is called photosensitivity",Polymorphous light eruption
"It results in immune system activity that causes a rash",Polymorphous light eruption
"UV radiation UV radiation is a wavelength of sunlight in a range too short for the human eye to see",Polymorphous light eruption
"UV light that reaches the earth is divided into two wavelength bands — ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB)",Polymorphous light eruption
"A person with photosensitivity can react to both types of UV radiation",Polymorphous light eruption
"Although UVB doesn't penetrate glass, UVA does",Polymorphous light eruption
"UVA may even penetrate through most sunscreens",Polymorphous light eruption
"So exposure to sunlight through windows or even sunscreen-protected skin may cause a reaction in some people with photosensitivity",Polymorphous light eruption
"Photosensitivity Sensitivity to sunlight lessens with repeated exposure in polymorphous light eruption",Polymorphous light eruption
"Features of polymorphous light eruption are somewhat predictable: An episode is most likely to occur after the first one or two exposures to sunlight after a long period of no exposure",Polymorphous light eruption
"This usually means that an episode occurs during the spring or early summer or during a winter vacation in a sunnier location",Polymorphous light eruption

"While tobacco use clearly plays a role in the development of Buerger's disease, it's not clear how it does so",Buerger's disease
"Experts suspect that some people may have a genetic predisposition to the disease",Buerger's disease
"It's also possible that the disease is caused by an autoimmune response in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue",Buerger's disease
"But Buerger's disease can occur in people who use any form of tobacco, including cigars and chewing tobacco",Buerger's disease
"People who smoke hand-rolled cigarettes using raw tobacco may have the greatest risk of Buerger's disease",Buerger's disease
"It isn't clear how tobacco use increases your risk of Buerger's disease, but virtually everyone diagnosed with Buerger's disease uses tobacco",Buerger's disease

"These glands are located just above your kidneys",Addison's disease
"As part of your endocrine system, they produce hormones that give instructions to virtually every organ and tissue in your body",Addison's disease
"Your adrenal glands are composed of two sections",Addison's disease
"The interior (medulla) produces adrenaline-like hormones",Addison's disease
"The outer layer (cortex) produces a group of hormones called corticosteroids, which include glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and male sex hormones (androgens)",Addison's disease
"Some of the hormones the cortex produces are essential for life — the glucocorticoids and the mineralocorticoids",Addison's disease

"Primary adrenal insufficiency Addison's disease occurs when the cortex is damaged and doesn't produce its hormones in adequate quantities",Addison's disease
"Doctors refer to the condition involving damage to the adrenal glands as primary adrenal insufficiency",Addison's disease
"The failure of your adrenal glands to produce adrenocortical hormones is most commonly the result of the body attacking itself (autoimmune disease)",Addison's disease
"For unknown reasons, your immune system views the adrenal cortex as foreign, something to attack and destroy",Addison's disease
"Other causes of adrenal gland failure may include: Tuberculosis Other infections of the adrenal glands Spread of cancer to the adrenal glands Bleeding into the adrenal glands, which may present as adrenal crisis without any preceding symptoms",Addison's disease
"Secondary adrenal insufficiency Adrenal insufficiency can also occur if your pituitary gland is diseased",Addison's disease
"The pituitary gland makes a hormone called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce its hormones",Addison's disease

"Imbalances in brain chemicals — including serotonin, which helps regulate pain in your nervous system — also may be involved",Migraine
"Researchers are still studying the role of serotonin in migraines",Migraine
"Serotonin levels drop during migraine attacks",Migraine
"This may cause your trigeminal nerve to release substances called neuropeptides, which travel to your brain's outer covering (meninges)",Migraine
"The result is migraine pain",Migraine
"Other neurotransmitters play a role in the pain of migraine, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)",Migraine
"Migraine triggers A number of factors may trigger migraines, including: Hormonal changes in women",Migraine
"Fluctuations in estrogen seem to trigger headaches in many women",Migraine
"Women with a history of migraines often report headaches immediately before or during their periods, when they have a major drop in estrogen",Migraine
"Others have an increased tendency to develop migraines during pregnancy or menopause",Migraine

"Medication-overuse headaches",Migraine
"Taking over-the-counter or prescription headache medications more than 10 days a month for three months or in high doses may trigger serious medication-overuse headaches",Migraine
"Medication-overuse headaches occur when medications stop relieving pain and begin to cause headaches",Migraine
"You then use more pain medication, which continues the cycle",Migraine
"Serotonin syndrome",Migraine
"Serotonin syndrome is a rare, potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when your body has too much of the nervous system chemical called serotonin",Migraine
"While the risk is considered extremely low, taking migraine medications called triptans and antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome",Migraine
"These medications naturally raise serotonin levels, and it is possible that combining them could cause levels that are too high",Migraine
"Triptans and SSRIs or SNRIs may be used together, but it's important to watch out for possible symptoms of serotonin syndrome such as changes in cognition, behavior and muscle control (such as involuntary jerking)",Migraine
"Triptans include medications such as sumatriptan (Imitrex) or zolmitriptan (Zomig)",Migraine
"Some common SSRIs include sertraline (Zoloft), fluoxetine (Sarafem, Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil)",Migraine

"Sagittal craniosynostosis is the most common type",Craniosynostosis
"Coronal",Craniosynostosis
"Premature fusion of one of the coronal sutures (unicoronal) that run from each ear to the top of the skull may cause your baby's forehead to flatten on the affected side and bulge on the unaffected side",Craniosynostosis
"It also leads to turning of the nose and elevation of the eye socket on the affected side",Craniosynostosis
"When both of the coronal sutures fuse prematurely (bicoronal), it gives your baby's head a short and wide appearance, most commonly with the forehead tilted forward",Craniosynostosis
"Metopic",Craniosynostosis

"It may cause one side of your baby's head to appear flat, one ear to be higher than the other ear and tilting of the top of the head to one side",Craniosynostosis
"Other reasons for a misshapen head A misshapen head doesn't always indicate craniosynostosis",Craniosynostosis
"For example, if the back of your baby's head appears flattened, it could be the result of your baby spending too much time on one side of his or her head",Craniosynostosis
"This can be treated with regular position changes, or if significant, with helmet therapy (cranial orthosis) to help reshape the head to a more normal appearance",Craniosynostosis

"But family history and genetics appear to play an important role",Prediabetes
"Inactivity and excess fat — especially abdominal fat — also seem to be important factors",Prediabetes
"What is clear is that people with prediabetes don't process sugar (glucose) properly anymore",Prediabetes
"As a result, sugar accumulates in the bloodstream instead of doing its normal job of fueling the cells that make up muscles and other tissues",Prediabetes
"Most of the glucose in your body comes from the food you eat",Prediabetes
"When food is digested, sugar enters your bloodstream",Prediabetes
"Moving sugar from your bloodstream to your body's cells requires a hormone (insulin)",Prediabetes
"Insulin comes from a gland located behind the stomach (pancreas)",Prediabetes
"Your pancreas secretes insulin into your bloodstream when you eat",Prediabetes
"As insulin circulates, it allows sugar to enter your cells — and lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream",Prediabetes
"As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas",Prediabetes
"When you have prediabetes, this process begins to work improperly",Prediabetes
"Instead of fueling your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream",Prediabetes
"High blood sugar occurs when your pancreas doesn't make enough insulin or your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, or both",Prediabetes
"These factors include: Weight",Prediabetes
"Being overweight is a primary risk factor for prediabetes",Prediabetes
"The more fatty tissue you have — especially inside and between the muscle and skin around your abdomen — the more resistant your cells become to insulin",Prediabetes

"Inactivity",Prediabetes
"The less active you are, the greater your risk of prediabetes",Prediabetes
"Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin",Prediabetes
"Although diabetes can develop at any age, the risk of prediabetes increases after age 45",Prediabetes
"This may be because people tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as they age",Prediabetes
"Your risk of prediabetes increases if you have a parent or sibling with type 2 diabetes",Prediabetes
"Although it's unclear why, people of certain races — including African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders — are more likely to develop prediabetes",Prediabetes

"Many people, particularly older adults, don't feel thirsty until they're already dehydrated",Dehydration
"That's why it's important to increase water intake during hot weather or when you're ill",Dehydration
"The signs and symptoms of dehydration also may differ by age",Dehydration
"Other dehydration causes include: Diarrhea, vomiting",Dehydration

"If you do vigorous activity and don't replace fluids as you go along, you can become dehydrated",Dehydration
"Hot, humid weather increases the amount you sweat and the amount of fluid you lose",Dehydration
"Increased urination",Dehydration
"This may be due to undiagnosed or uncontrolled diabetes",Dehydration
"Certain medications, such as diuretics and some blood pressure medications, also can lead to dehydration, generally because they cause you to urinate more",Dehydration

"In women, the urethral opening is located just above the vagina",Overactive bladder
"In men, the urethral opening is at the tip of the penis",Overactive bladder
"As your bladder fills, nerve signals sent to your brain eventually trigger the need to urinate",Overactive bladder
"When you urinate, nerve signals coordinate the relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles and the muscles of the urethra (urinary sphincter muscles)",Overactive bladder
"The muscles of the bladder tighten (contract), pushing the urine out",Overactive bladder
"Involuntary bladder contractions Overactive bladder occurs because the muscles of the bladder start to contract involuntarily even when the volume of urine in your bladder is low",Overactive bladder
"This involuntary contraction creates the urgent need to urinate",Overactive bladder

"These include: Difficulty breast-feeding or an inability to breast-feed No menstrual periods (amenorrhea) or infrequent menstruation (oligomenorrhea) Inability to regrow shaved pubic hair Slowed mental function, weight gain and difficulty staying warm as a result of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) Low blood pressure (hypotension) Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) Fatigue Irregular heartbeat Breast shrinkage For many women, Sheehan's syndrome symptoms are nonspecific and often thought to be caused by other things",Sheehan's syndrome
"Fatigue, for instance, goes hand in hand with being a new mother",Sheehan's syndrome
"You might not realize you have Sheehan's syndrome until you need treatment for thyroid or adrenal insufficiency",Sheehan's syndrome
"It's also possible to remain relatively symptom-free with Sheehan's syndrome, depending on the extent of damage to the pituitary gland",Sheehan's syndrome
"Some women live for years not knowing their pituitary isn't working properly",Sheehan's syndrome
"Then an extreme physical stressor, such as severe infection or surgery, triggers an adrenal crisis",Sheehan's syndrome
"These factors can be particularly damaging to the pituitary gland, which enlarges during pregnancy, destroying hormone-producing tissue so that the gland can't function normally",Sheehan's syndrome
"Pituitary hormones regulate the rest of your endocrine system, signaling other glands to increase or decrease production of the hormones that control metabolism, fertility, blood pressure, breast milk production and many other vital processes",Sheehan's syndrome
"A lack of any of these hormones can cause problems throughout your body",Sheehan's syndrome
"Hormones from the front of your pituitary include: Growth hormone (GH)",Sheehan's syndrome

"However, if these treatments don't help, call your doctor",Nickel allergy
"If you think the area may have become infected, see your doctor right away",Nickel allergy
"As with other allergies, nickel allergy develops when your immune system views nickel as a harmful, rather than harmless substance",Nickel allergy
"Normally, your immune system only reacts to protect your body against bacteria, viruses or toxic substances",Nickel allergy
"Once your body has developed a reaction to a particular agent (allergen) — in this case, nickel — your immune system will always be sensitive to it",Nickel allergy
"That means anytime you come into contact with nickel, your immune system will respond and produce an allergic response",Nickel allergy

"Signs and symptoms of this condition, known as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, include: Fever A cough that may bring up blood or plugs of mucus Worsening asthma Fungal mass A growth of tangled fungus fibers (fungus ball) may develop in air spaces (cavities) in the lung as part of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis",Aspergillosis
"This type of aspergillosis is called simple aspergilloma",Aspergillosis
"Lung cavities may develop in people with pre-existing lung conditions, such as emphysema, tuberculosis or advanced sarcoidosis",Aspergillosis
"Aspergilloma is a benign condition that may not produce symptoms or may produce a mild cough only, but over time, the underlying condition can worsen and possibly cause: A cough that often brings up blood (hemoptysis), sometimes large amounts Wheezing Shortness of breath Unintentional weight loss Fatigue Infection Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis — the most severe form — occurs when the infection spreads rapidly from the lungs to your brain, heart, kidneys or skin",Aspergillosis
"This occurs only in people whose immune system is weakened, commonly from chemotherapy",Aspergillosis
"Untreated, this form of aspergilla disease is usually fatal",Aspergillosis
"Signs and symptoms depend on which organs are affected, but in general, invasive aspergillosis can cause: Fever and chills Cough that brings up blood-streaked sputum (hemoptysis) Severe bleeding from your lungs Shortness of breath Chest or joint pain Headaches or eye symptoms Nosebleed Facial swelling on one side Skin lesions Other types of aspergillosis Aspergillus can invade areas of the body other than your lungs, such as your sinuses",Aspergillosis
"In your sinuses, it can cause a stuffy nose, drainage that's possibly bloody, inflammation, fever, facial pain and headache",Aspergillosis
"Although aspergillosis may not be the cause, it's important to have problems evaluated",Aspergillosis
"If you have a weakened immune system and develop an unexplained fever, shortness of breath or a cough that brings up blood, get immediate medical care",Aspergillosis
"In the case of invasive aspergillosis, prompt treatment is crucial, and treatment is sometimes started before the infection is diagnosed",Aspergillosis
"Early signs and symptoms often overlap with those of other common conditions",Hemochromatosis
"Common symptoms include: Joint pain Abdominal pain Fatigue Weakness Later signs and symptoms of the disease may include: Diabetes Loss of sex drive Impotence Heart failure Liver failure When signs and symptoms typically appear Hereditary hemochromatosis is present at birth",Hemochromatosis
"But, most people don't experience signs and symptoms until later in life — usually between the ages of 50 and 60 in men and after age 60 in women",Hemochromatosis
"Women are more likely to develop symptoms after menopause, when they no longer lose iron with menstruation and pregnancy",Hemochromatosis
"If you have an immediate family member who has hemochromatosis, ask your doctor about genetic tests that can determine if you have inherited the gene that increases your risk of hemochromatosis",Hemochromatosis
"liver cirrhosis Hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by a mutation in a gene that controls the amount of iron your body absorbs from the food you eat",Hemochromatosis
"These mutations are passed from parents to children",Hemochromatosis
"This type of hemochromatosis is by far the most common type",Hemochromatosis
"Gene mutations that cause hemochromatosis A gene called HFE is most often the cause of hereditary hemochromatosis",Hemochromatosis
"You inherit one HFE gene from each of your parents",Hemochromatosis
"The HFE gene has two common mutations, C282Y and H63D",Hemochromatosis
"Genetic testing can reveal whether you have these mutations in your HFE gene",Hemochromatosis
"If you inherit 2 abnormal genes, you may develop hemochromatosis",Hemochromatosis
"You can also pass the mutation on to your children",Hemochromatosis
"But, not everyone who inherits two genes develops problems linked to the iron overload of hemochromatosis",Hemochromatosis
"you may develop hemochromatosis",Hemochromatosis
"If you inherit 1 abnormal gene, you won't develop hemochromatosis",Hemochromatosis
"You are considered a gene mutation carrier and can pass the mutation on to your children",Hemochromatosis
"But, they wouldn't develop disease unless they also inherited another abnormal gene from the other parent",Hemochromatosis
"How hemochromatosis affects your organs Iron plays an essential role in several body functions, including helping in the formation of blood",Hemochromatosis
"But, too much iron is toxic",Hemochromatosis
"A hormone called hepcidin, secreted by the liver, normally controls how iron is used and absorbed in the body, as well as how excess iron is stored in various organs",Hemochromatosis
"In hemochromatosis, the normal role of hepcidin is disrupted, causing your body to absorb more iron that it needs",Hemochromatosis
"This excess iron is stored in major organs, especially your liver",Hemochromatosis
"Over a period of years, the stored iron can cause severe damage that may lead to organ failure and chronic diseases, such as cirrhosis, diabetes and heart failure",Hemochromatosis
"Though many people have faulty genes that cause hemochromatosis, only about 10 percent of them develop iron overload to a degree that causes tissue and organ damage",Hemochromatosis
"Hereditary hemochromatosis isn't the only type of hemochromatosis",Hemochromatosis
"Other types include: Juvenile hemochromatosis",Hemochromatosis
"This causes the same problems in young people that hereditary hemochromatosis causes in adults",Hemochromatosis
"But iron accumulation begins much earlier, and symptoms usually appear between the ages of 15 and 30",Hemochromatosis
"This disorder is caused by mutations in the hemojuvelin or hepcidin genes",Hemochromatosis
"Neonatal hemochromatosis",Hemochromatosis
"In this severe disorder, iron builds up rapidly in the liver of the developing fetus",Hemochromatosis
"It is thought to be an autoimmune disease, in which the body attacks itself",Hemochromatosis
"Secondary hemochromatosis",Hemochromatosis
"This form of the disease is not inherited and is often referred to as iron overload",Hemochromatosis
"People with certain types of anemia or chronic liver disease may need multiple blood transfusions, which can lead to excess iron accumulation",Hemochromatosis
"This is the greatest risk factor for hereditary hemochromatosis",Hemochromatosis
"If you have a first-degree relative — a parent or sibling — with hemochromatosis, you're more likely to develop the disease",Hemochromatosis
"Ethnicity",Hemochromatosis
"People of Northern European descent are more prone to hereditary hemochromatosis than are people of other ethnic backgrounds",Hemochromatosis
"Hemochromatosis is less common in African-Americans, Hispanics and Asian-Americans",Hemochromatosis
"Men are more likely than women to develop signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis at an earlier age",Hemochromatosis
"Because women lose iron through menstruation and pregnancy, they tend to store less of the mineral than men do",Hemochromatosis
"After menopause or a hysterectomy, the risk for women increases",Hemochromatosis
"liver cirrhosis Untreated, hereditary hemochromatosis can lead to a number of complications, especially in your joints and in organs where excess iron tends to be stored — your liver, pancreas and heart",Hemochromatosis

"The signs and symptoms can include those related to a form of spina bifida called myelomeningocele that nearly always accompanies Chiari malformation type II",Chiari malformation
"In myelomeningocele, the backbone and the spinal canal haven't closed properly before birth",Chiari malformation
"This form of Chiari malformation is diagnosed at birth or by an ultrasound during pregnancy",Chiari malformation
"This type of Chiari malformation has a higher mortality rate and may also cause neurological problems",Chiari malformation
"Because many symptoms of Chiari malformation can also be associated with other disorders, a thorough medical evaluation is important",Chiari malformation
"The lower part, or tonsils, of the cerebellum are displaced into your upper spinal canal",Chiari malformation
"Chiari malformation type II is nearly always associated with a form of spina bifida called myelomeningocele",Chiari malformation
"When the cerebellum is pushed into your upper spinal canal, it can interfere with the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid that protects your brain and spinal cord",Chiari malformation
"This impaired circulation of cerebrospinal fluid can lead to the blockage of signals transmitted from your brain to your body, or to a buildup of spinal fluid in the brain or spinal cord",Chiari malformation
"Alternatively, the pressure from the cerebellum upon the spinal cord or lower brainstem can cause neurological signs or symptoms",Chiari malformation
"However, research into a possible hereditary component is still in its early phase",Chiari malformation
"The complications associated with this condition include:",Chiari malformation

"When you have bulimia, you have episodes of bingeing and purging that involve feeling a lack of control over your eating",Eating disorders
"Many people with bulimia also restrict their eating during the day, which often leads to more binge eating and purging",Eating disorders
"During these episodes, you typically eat a large amount of food in a short time, and then try to rid yourself of the extra calories in an unhealthy way",Eating disorders
"Because of guilt, shame and an intense fear of weight gain from overeating, you may force vomiting (purging bulimia), exercise too much, or use other methods, such as laxatives, to get rid of the calories (nonpurging bulimia)",Eating disorders

"When the condition is diagnosed and treated early, it's more like that you'll have a good outcome and a reduced risk of complications from the disease and its treatment",Churg-Strauss syndrome
"It's likely that an overactive immune system response is triggered by a combination of genes and environmental factors, such as allergens or certain medications",Churg-Strauss syndrome
"Instead of simply protecting against invading organisms such as bacteria and viruses, the immune system overreacts and targets healthy tissue, causing widespread inflammation",Churg-Strauss syndrome
"Some people have developed Churg-Strauss syndrome after using an asthma and allergy medication called montelukast or after switching from low-dose oral systemic steroids to inhaled steroid medications",Churg-Strauss syndrome

"In people who have Marfan syndrome, this is most likely to happen at the aortic root — where the artery leaves your heart",Marfan syndrome
"Aortic dissection",Marfan syndrome
"The wall of the aorta is made up of layers",Marfan syndrome
"Dissection occurs when a small tear in the innermost layer of the aorta's wall allows blood to squeeze in between the inner and outer layers of the wall",Marfan syndrome
"This can cause severe pain in the chest or back",Marfan syndrome
"An aortic dissection weakens the vessel's structure and can result in a rupture, which may be fatal",Marfan syndrome
"Valve malformations",Marfan syndrome
"People who have Marfan syndrome also are more likely to have problems with their heart valves, which may be malformed or overly elastic",Marfan syndrome

"Keep in mind that warning signs are just that — warning signs",Child abuse
"The presence of warning signs doesn't necessarily mean that a child is being abused",Child abuse
"Warning signs include a parent who: Shows little concern for the child Appears unable to recognize physical or emotional distress in the child Denies that any problems exist at home or school, or blames the child for the problems Consistently blames, belittles or berates the child and describes the child with negative terms, such as worthless or evil Expects the child to provide him or her with attention and care and seems jealous of other family members getting attention from the child Uses harsh physical discipline or asks teachers to do so Demands an inappropriate level of physical or academic performance Severely limits the child's contact with others Offers conflicting or unconvincing explanations for a child's injuries or no explanation at all Although most child health experts condemn the use of violence in any form, some people still use corporal punishment, such as spanking, as a way to discipline their children",Child abuse
"Any corporal punishment may leave emotional scars",Child abuse
"Parental behaviors that cause pain or physical injury — even when done in the name of discipline — could be child abuse",Child abuse

"In some cases of pleurisy, fluid builds up in the small space between the two layers of tissue (pleural space)",Pleurisy
"This is called pleural effusion",Pleurisy
"When there is a fair amount of fluid, pleuritic pain lessens or disappears because the two layers of pleura are no longer in contact",Pleurisy
"A large amount of fluid in the pleural space can create pressure, compressing your lung to the point that it partially or completely collapses",Pleurisy
"This makes breathing difficult and might cause you to cough",Pleurisy
"The extra fluid can also become infected",Pleurisy
"This is called an empyema",Pleurisy
"An empyema is often accompanied by fever",Pleurisy
"You might have a problem with your lungs, heart or pleura or an underlying illness for which you need prompt medical care",Pleurisy
"One layer wraps around the outside of the lungs",Pleurisy
"The other layer lines the inner chest wall",Pleurisy
"Between these two layers is a small space (pleural space) that's usually filled with a very small amount of liquid",Pleurisy
"The layers act like two pieces of smooth satin gliding past each other, allowing your lungs to expand and contract when you breathe without any resistance from the lining of the chest wall",Pleurisy
"Pleurisy occurs when the pleura becomes irritated and inflamed",Pleurisy
"As a result, the two layers of the pleural membrane rub against each other like two pieces of sandpaper, producing pain when you inhale and exhale",Pleurisy
"The pleuritic pain lessens or stops when you hold your breath",Pleurisy

"Signs and symptoms depend on when the condition develops",Male hypogonadism
"Fetal development If the body doesn't produce enough testosterone during fetal development, the result may be impaired growth of the external sex organs",Male hypogonadism
"Depending on when hypogonadism develops and how much testosterone is present, a child who is genetically male may be born with: Female genitals Ambiguous genitals — genitals that are neither clearly male nor clearly female Underdeveloped male genitals Puberty Male hypogonadism may delay puberty or cause incomplete or lack of normal development",Male hypogonadism
"It can cause: Decreased development of muscle mass Lack of deepening of the voice Impaired growth of body hair Impaired growth of the penis and testicles Excessive growth of the arms and legs in relation to the trunk of the body Development of breast tissue (gynecomastia) Adulthood In adult males, hypogonadism may alter certain masculine physical characteristics and impair normal reproductive function",Male hypogonadism

"Establishing the cause of hypogonadism is an important first step to getting appropriate treatment",Male hypogonadism
"There are two basic types of hypogonadism: Primary",Male hypogonadism
"This type of hypogonadism — also known as primary testicular failure — originates from a problem in the testicles",Male hypogonadism
"Secondary",Male hypogonadism
"This type of hypogonadism indicates a problem in the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland — parts of the brain that signal the testicles to produce testosterone",Male hypogonadism
"The hypothalamus produces gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which signals the pituitary gland to make follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)",Male hypogonadism
"Luteinizing hormone then signals the testes to produce testosterone",Male hypogonadism
"Either type of hypogonadism may be caused by an inherited (congenital) trait or something that happens later in life (acquired), such as an injury or an infection",Male hypogonadism
"At times, primary and secondary hypogonadism can occur together",Male hypogonadism
"Primary hypogonadism Common causes of primary hypogonadism include: Klinefelter syndrome",Male hypogonadism
"This condition results from a congenital abnormality of the sex chromosomes, X and Y",Male hypogonadism
"A male normally has one X and one Y chromosome",Male hypogonadism
"In Klinefelter syndrome, two or more X chromosomes are present in addition to one Y chromosome",Male hypogonadism
"The Y chromosome contains the genetic material that determines the sex of a child and related development",Male hypogonadism
"The extra X chromosome that occurs in Klinefelter syndrome causes abnormal development of the testicles, which in turn results in underproduction of testosterone",Male hypogonadism
"Undescended testicles",Male hypogonadism
"Before birth, the testicles develop inside the abdomen and normally move down into their permanent place in the scrotum",Male hypogonadism
"Sometimes one or both of the testicles may not be descended at birth",Male hypogonadism
"This condition often corrects itself within the first few years of life without treatment",Male hypogonadism
"If not corrected in early childhood, it may lead to malfunction of the testicles and reduced production of testosterone",Male hypogonadism
"Mumps orchitis",Male hypogonadism
"If a mumps infection involving the testicles in addition to the salivary glands (mumps orchitis) occurs during adolescence or adulthood, long-term testicular damage may occur",Male hypogonadism
"This may affect normal testicular function and testosterone production",Male hypogonadism
"Hemochromatosis",Male hypogonadism
"Too much iron in the blood can cause testicular failure or pituitary gland dysfunction, affecting testosterone production",Male hypogonadism
"Injury to the testicles",Male hypogonadism
"Because they're situated outside the abdomen, the testicles are prone to injury",Male hypogonadism
"Damage to normally developed testicles can cause hypogonadism",Male hypogonadism
"Damage to one testicle may not impair total testosterone production",Male hypogonadism
"Chemotherapy or radiation therapy for the treatment of cancer can interfere with testosterone and sperm production",Male hypogonadism

"Sometimes celiac disease is triggered — or becomes active for the first time — after surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, viral infection or severe emotional stress",Celiac disease
"When the body's immune system overreacts to gluten in food, the reaction damages the tiny, hair-like projections (villi) that line the small intestine",Celiac disease
"Villi absorb vitamins, minerals and other nutrients from the food you eat",Celiac disease
"If your villi are damaged, you can't get enough nutrients, no matter how much you eat",Celiac disease
"Some gene variations appear to increase the risk of developing the disease",Celiac disease
"But having those gene variants doesn't mean you'll get celiac disease, which suggests that additional factors must be involved",Celiac disease

"Nonresponsive celiac disease As many as 30 percent of people with celiac disease may not have, or be able to maintain, a good response to a gluten-free diet",Celiac disease
"This condition, known as nonresponsive celiac disease, is often due to contamination of the diet with gluten",Celiac disease
"Therefore it's important to work with a dietitian",Celiac disease

"Rarely, hair pulling ends within a few years of starting",Trichotillomania
"Trichotillomania is not just a bad habit, it's a mental health disorder, and it's unlikely to get better without treatment",Trichotillomania
"But like many complex disorders, trichotillomania probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors",Trichotillomania
"Genetics may play a role in the development of trichotillomania, and the disorder may occur in those who have a close relative with the disorder",Trichotillomania
"Trichotillomania usually develops just before or during the early teens — most often between the ages of 10 and 13 years — and it's often a lifelong problem",Trichotillomania

"For people at high risk, prompt treatment is critical",Legionnaires' disease
"Outdoors, legionella bacteria survive in soil and water, but rarely cause infections",Legionnaires' disease
"Indoors, though, legionella bacteria can multiply in all kinds of water systems — hot tubs, air conditioners and mist sprayers in grocery store produce departments",Legionnaires' disease
"Although it's possible to contract legionnaires' disease from home plumbing systems, most outbreaks have occurred in large buildings, perhaps because complex systems allow the bacteria to grow and spread more easily",Legionnaires' disease
"How the infection spreads Most people become infected when they inhale microscopic water droplets containing legionella bacteria",Legionnaires' disease
"This might be the spray from a shower, faucet or whirlpool, or water dispersed through the ventilation system in a large building",Legionnaires' disease
"Outbreaks have been linked to a range of sources, including: Hot tubs and whirlpools on cruise ships Grocery store mist machines Cooling towers in air conditioning systems Decorative fountains Swimming pools Physical therapy equipment Water systems in hotels, hospitals and nursing homes Although legionella bacteria primarily spread through aerosolized water droplets, the infection can be transmitted in other ways, including: Aspiration",Legionnaires' disease
"This occurs when liquids accidentally enter your lungs, usually because you cough or choke while drinking",Legionnaires' disease
"If you aspirate water containing legionella bacteria, you may develop legionnaires' disease",Legionnaires' disease
"Soil",Legionnaires' disease
"A few people have contracted legionnaires' disease after working in the garden or using contaminated potting soil",Legionnaires' disease

"Septic shock",Legionnaires' disease
"This occurs when a severe, sudden drop in blood pressure reduces blood flow to vital organs, especially to the kidneys and brain",Legionnaires' disease
"The heart tries to compensate by increasing the volume of blood pumped, but the extra workload eventually weakens the heart and reduces blood flow even further",Legionnaires' disease
"Acute kidney failure",Legionnaires' disease
"This is the sudden loss of your kidneys' ability to perform their main function — filtering waste material from your blood",Legionnaires' disease
"When your kidneys fail, dangerous levels of fluid and waste accumulate in your body",Legionnaires' disease
"When not treated effectively and promptly, legionnaires' disease may be fatal, especially if your immune system is weakened by disease or medications",Legionnaires' disease
"The condition usually begins as a thickening of the skin on the palm of your hand",Dupuytren's contracture

"In many cases, more than one cause is involved",Chronic cough
"The following causes, alone or in combination, are responsible for the majority of cases of chronic cough: Postnasal drip",Chronic cough
"When your nose or sinuses produce extra mucus, it can drip down the back of your throat and trigger your cough reflex",Chronic cough
"This condition is also called upper airway cough syndrome (UACS)",Chronic cough
"An asthma-related cough may come and go with the seasons, appear after an upper respiratory tract infection, or become worse when you're exposed to cold air or certain chemicals or fragrances",Chronic cough
"In one type of asthma (cough-variant asthma), a cough is the main symptom",Chronic cough
"In this common condition, stomach acid flows back into the tube that connects your stomach and throat (esophagus)",Chronic cough
"The constant irritation can lead to chronic coughing",Chronic cough
"The coughing, in turn, worsens GERD — a vicious cycle",Chronic cough
"A cough can linger long after other symptoms of pneumonia, flu, a cold or other infection of the upper respiratory tract have gone away",Chronic cough
"A common but under-recognized cause of a chronic cough in adults is pertussis, also known as whooping cough",Chronic cough
"Blood pressure drugs",Chronic cough
"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are commonly prescribed for high blood pressure and heart failure, are known to cause chronic cough in some people",Chronic cough
"This long-standing inflammation of your major airways (bronchial tubes) can cause a cough that brings up colored sputum",Chronic cough

"In fact, you can have type 2 diabetes for years and not know it",Type 2 diabetes
"Look for: Increased thirst and frequent urination",Type 2 diabetes
"Excess sugar building up in your bloodstream causes fluid to be pulled from the tissues",Type 2 diabetes
"This may leave you thirsty",Type 2 diabetes
"As a result, you may drink — and urinate — more than usual",Type 2 diabetes
"Without enough insulin to move sugar into your cells, your muscles and organs become depleted of energy",Type 2 diabetes
"Despite eating more than usual to relieve hunger, you may lose weight",Type 2 diabetes
"Without the ability to metabolize glucose, the body uses alternative fuels stored in muscle and fat",Type 2 diabetes
"Calories are lost as excess glucose is released in the urine",Type 2 diabetes

"Some people with type 2 diabetes have patches of dark, velvety skin in the folds and creases of their bodies — usually in the armpits and neck",Type 2 diabetes
"This condition, called acanthosis nigricans, may be a sign of insulin resistance",Type 2 diabetes
"Exactly why this happens is unknown, although genetics and environmental factors, such as excess weight and inactivity, seem to be contributing factors",Type 2 diabetes
"How insulin works Insulin is a hormone that comes from the gland situated behind and below the stomach (pancreas)",Type 2 diabetes
"The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream",Type 2 diabetes
"The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells",Type 2 diabetes
"Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream",Type 2 diabetes
"The role of glucose Glucose — a sugar — is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues",Type 2 diabetes
"Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver",Type 2 diabetes
"Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin",Type 2 diabetes
"Your liver stores and makes glucose",Type 2 diabetes
"When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range",Type 2 diabetes
"In type 2 diabetes, this process doesn't work well",Type 2 diabetes
"Instead of moving into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream",Type 2 diabetes
"As blood sugar levels increase, the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas release more insulin, but eventually these cells become impaired and can't make enough insulin to meet the body's demands",Type 2 diabetes
"In the much less common type 1 diabetes, the immune system destroys the beta cells, leaving the body with little to no insulin",Type 2 diabetes
"It's clear, however, that certain factors increase the risk, including: Weight",Type 2 diabetes
"Being overweight is a primary risk factor for type 2 diabetes",Type 2 diabetes
"The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin",Type 2 diabetes
"However, you don't have to be overweight to develop type 2 diabetes",Type 2 diabetes
"Fat distribution",Type 2 diabetes
"If your body stores fat primarily in your abdomen, your risk of type 2 diabetes is greater than if your body stores fat elsewhere, such as your hips and thighs",Type 2 diabetes
"The less active you are, the greater your risk of type 2 diabetes",Type 2 diabetes
"The risk of type 2 diabetes increases if your parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes",Type 2 diabetes
"Although it's unclear why, people of certain races — including blacks, Hispanics, American Indians and Asian-Americans — are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than whites are",Type 2 diabetes
"The risk of type 2 diabetes increases as you get older, especially after age 45",Type 2 diabetes
"That's probably because people tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as they age",Type 2 diabetes
"But type 2 diabetes is also increasing dramatically among children, adolescents and younger adults",Type 2 diabetes
"Prediabetes",Type 2 diabetes
"Prediabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes",Type 2 diabetes
"Left untreated, prediabetes often progresses to type 2 diabetes",Type 2 diabetes
"If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases",Type 2 diabetes
"If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms), you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes",Type 2 diabetes
"Polycystic ovarian syndrome",Type 2 diabetes
"For women, having polycystic ovarian syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes",Type 2 diabetes
"But diabetes affects many major organs, including your heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys",Type 2 diabetes
"Controlling your blood sugar levels can help prevent these complications",Type 2 diabetes
"Although long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually, they can eventually be disabling or even life-threatening",Type 2 diabetes
"Some of the potential complications of diabetes include:",Type 2 diabetes
"See your doctor if you have shortness of breath",Pericardial effusion
"Pericardial effusion can also occur when the flow of pericardial fluids is blocked or when blood accumulates within the pericardium, such as from a chest trauma",Pericardial effusion
"Sometimes the cause can't be determined (idiopathic pericarditis)",Pericardial effusion
"However, too much fluid causes the pericardium to put pressure on the heart, which keeps the chambers from filling completely",Pericardial effusion
"This condition, called tamponade (tam-pon-AYD), results in poor blood circulation and an inadequate supply of oxygen to the body",Pericardial effusion
"Tamponade is life-threatening and requires emergent/urgent attention",Pericardial effusion

"If you have any of the other signs or symptoms listed and are concerned about your risk of fibromuscular dysplasia, see your doctor",Fibromuscular dysplasia
"Because fibromuscular dysplasia can be hereditary, tell your doctor about your family history of the disease, even before you show any symptoms so that he or she can be alert to changes that might suggest you have fibromuscular dysplasia",Fibromuscular dysplasia
"There's currently no genetic test for fibromuscular dysplasia",Fibromuscular dysplasia
"Genetics may play a role in the development of fibromuscular dysplasia",Fibromuscular dysplasia
"But, if another family member has fibromuscular dysplasia, you or a relative may never get fibromuscular dysplasia, or you might get the condition in a different artery or have a milder case or a more severe case than your family member's fibromuscular dysplasia",Fibromuscular dysplasia
"In addition, not everyone who has fibromuscular dysplasia has a relative with the disease",Fibromuscular dysplasia
"Because women have fibromuscular dysplasia more often than men do, hormones may be linked to the development of fibromuscular dysplasia",Fibromuscular dysplasia
"However, fibromuscular dysplasia is not linked to how many pregnancies women have had, when they give birth or whether they've taken birth control pills",Fibromuscular dysplasia
"Abnormally formed arteries",Fibromuscular dysplasia
"Fibromuscular dysplasia could be caused by inadequate oxygen to the arteries that supply your blood vessel walls with blood, which causes the vessels to form abnormally",Fibromuscular dysplasia
"It could also be caused if the position of your arteries in your body is abnormal, or if a medication or tobacco causes your arteries to develop abnormally",Fibromuscular dysplasia
"Once the artery develops abnormally, a cluster of cells builds in the artery wall, narrowing it and reducing blood flow",Fibromuscular dysplasia
"Women have a much greater risk of fibromuscular dysplasia than do men",Fibromuscular dysplasia
"Fibromuscular disorder tends to be diagnosed in people in their early 50s",Fibromuscular dysplasia
"People who smoke appear to have an increased risk of developing fibromuscular dysplasia",Fibromuscular dysplasia
"For those already diagnosed with the disease, smoking is a risk factor for more serious fibromuscular dysplasia",Fibromuscular dysplasia

"Foot deformities",Metatarsalgia NOS
"Wearing too-small shoes or high heels can cause your foot to be misshapen",Metatarsalgia NOS
"A downward-curling toe (hammertoe) and swollen, painful bumps at the base of your big toes (bunions) can cause metatarsalgia",Metatarsalgia NOS
"Because most of your body weight transfers to your forefoot when you move, extra pounds mean more pressure on your metatarsals",Metatarsalgia NOS
"Losing weight might reduce or eliminate symptoms",Metatarsalgia NOS
"Poorly fitting shoes",Metatarsalgia NOS
"High heels, which transfer extra weight to the front of your foot, are a common cause of metatarsalgia in women",Metatarsalgia NOS
"Shoes with a narrow toe box or athletic shoes that lack support and padding also can contribute to the problem",Metatarsalgia NOS
"Stress fractures",Metatarsalgia NOS
"Small breaks in the metatarsals or toe bones can be painful and change the way you put weight on your foot",Metatarsalgia NOS
"Morton's neuroma",Metatarsalgia NOS

"When you have low levels of this protein or it doesn't work as it should, small blood cells called platelets cannot stick together properly, nor can they attach themselves normally to the blood vessel walls when an injury has occurred",von Willebrand disease
"The result is interference with the clotting process, and, sometimes, uncontrolled bleeding",von Willebrand disease
"Von Willebrand factor carries an additional substance, called factor VIII, that helps stimulate clotting",von Willebrand disease
"Many people with von Willebrand disease also have low levels of factor VIII",von Willebrand disease

"A parent can pass the abnormal gene for the disease to his or her child",von Willebrand disease
"Most cases are autosomal dominant inherited disorders, which means you only need an abnormal gene from one parent to be affected",von Willebrand disease
"If you have the gene for von Willebrand disease, you have a 50 percent chance of transmitting this gene to your offspring",von Willebrand disease
"The most severe form of the condition (type 3) is autosomal recessive, which means both of your parents have to pass an abnormal gene to you",von Willebrand disease

"It's not clear what initially sets off this process, but doctors have discovered how it progresses into chronic myelogenous leukemia",Chronic myelogenous leukemia
"First, an abnormal chromosome develops Human cells normally contain 23 pairs of chromosomes",Chronic myelogenous leukemia
"These chromosomes hold the DNA that contains the instructions (genes) that control the cells in your body",Chronic myelogenous leukemia
"In people with chronic myelogenous leukemia, the chromosomes in the blood cells swap sections with each other",Chronic myelogenous leukemia
"A section of chromosome 9 switches places with a section of chromosome 22, creating an extra-short chromosome 22 and an extra-long chromosome 9",Chronic myelogenous leukemia

"The Philadelphia chromosome is present in the blood cells of 90 percent of people with chronic myelogenous leukemia",Chronic myelogenous leukemia
"Second, the abnormal chromosome creates a new gene The Philadelphia chromosome creates a new gene",Chronic myelogenous leukemia
"Genes from chromosome 9 combine with genes from chromosome 22 to create a new gene called BCR-ABL",Chronic myelogenous leukemia
"The BCR-ABL gene contains instructions that tell the abnormal blood cell to produce too much of a protein called tyrosine kinase",Chronic myelogenous leukemia
"Tyrosine kinase promotes cancer by allowing certain blood cells to grow out of control",Chronic myelogenous leukemia
"Third, the new gene allows too many diseased blood cells Your blood cells originate in the bone marrow, a spongy material inside your bones",Chronic myelogenous leukemia
"When your bone marrow functions normally, it produces immature cells (blood stem cells) in a controlled way",Chronic myelogenous leukemia
"These cells then mature and specialize into the various types of blood cells that circulate in your body — red cells, white cells and platelets",Chronic myelogenous leukemia
"In chronic myelogenous leukemia, this process doesn't work properly",Chronic myelogenous leukemia
"The tyrosine kinase caused by the BCR-ABL gene causes too many white blood cells",Chronic myelogenous leukemia
"Most or all of these cells contain the abnormal Philadelphia chromosome",Chronic myelogenous leukemia
"The diseased white blood cells don't grow and die like normal cells",Chronic myelogenous leukemia
"The diseased white blood cells build up in huge numbers, crowding out healthy blood cells and damaging the bone marrow",Chronic myelogenous leukemia
"This mutation is believed to be acquired, meaning it develops after birth",Chronic myelogenous leukemia

"The discharge probably doesn't signal anything abnormal, including breast cancer, but you should still see a doctor for evaluation",Galactorrhea NOS
"Nonmilky nipple discharge — particularly bloody, yellow or clear spontaneous discharge that comes from one duct or is associated with a lump you can feel — requires prompt medical attention, as it may be a sign of an underlying breast cancer",Galactorrhea NOS
"Prolactin is produced by your pituitary gland, a marble-sized gland at the base of your brain that secretes and regulates several hormones",Galactorrhea NOS
"Possible causes of galactorrhea include: Medications, such as certain sedatives, antidepressants, antipsychotics and high blood pressure drugs Cocaine, marijuana or opioid use Herbal supplements, such as fennel, anise or fenugreek seed Birth control pills Noncancerous pituitary tumor (prolactinoma) or other disorder of the pituitary gland Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) Chronic kidney disease Excessive breast stimulation, which may be associated with sexual activity, frequent breast self-exams with nipple manipulation or prolonged clothing friction Nerve damage to the chest wall from chest surgery, burns or other chest injuries Spinal cord surgery, injury or tumors Idiopathic galactorrhea Sometimes doctors can't find a cause for galactorrhea",Galactorrhea NOS
"This is called idiopathic galactorrhea, and it may just mean that your breast tissue is particularly sensitive to the milk-producing hormone prolactin in your blood",Galactorrhea NOS
"If you have increased sensitivity to prolactin, even normal prolactin levels can lead to galactorrhea",Galactorrhea NOS
"Galactorrhea in men In males, galactorrhea may be associated with testosterone deficiency (male hypogonadism) and usually occurs with breast enlargement or tenderness (gynecomastia)",Galactorrhea NOS

"Some people with MS experience a gradual onset and steady progression of signs and symptoms without any relapses",Multiple sclerosis
"This is known as primary-progressive MS",Multiple sclerosis
"It's considered an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues",Multiple sclerosis
"In the case of MS, this immune system malfunction destroys myelin (the fatty substance that coats and protects nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord)",Multiple sclerosis
"Myelin can be compared to the insulation coating on electrical wires",Multiple sclerosis
"When the protective myelin is damaged and nerve fiber is exposed, the messages that travel along that nerve may be slowed or blocked",Multiple sclerosis

"Early diagnosis and treatment can stop atherosclerosis from worsening and prevent a heart attack, stroke or another medical emergency",Arteriosclerosis/atherosclerosis
"Although the exact cause is unknown, atherosclerosis may start with damage or injury to the inner layer of an artery",Arteriosclerosis/atherosclerosis
"The damage may be caused by: High blood pressure High cholesterol High triglycerides, a type of fat (lipid) in your blood Smoking and other sources of tobacco Insulin resistance, obesity or diabetes Inflammation from diseases, such as arthritis, lupus or infections, or inflammation of unknown cause Once the inner wall of an artery is damaged, blood cells and other substances often clump at the injury site and build up in the inner lining of the artery",Arteriosclerosis/atherosclerosis
"Over time, fatty deposits (plaques) made of cholesterol and other cellular products also build up at the injury site and harden, narrowing your arteries",Arteriosclerosis/atherosclerosis
"The organs and tissues connected to the blocked arteries then don't receive enough blood to function properly",Arteriosclerosis/atherosclerosis
"Eventually, pieces of the fatty deposits may break off and enter your bloodstream",Arteriosclerosis/atherosclerosis
"In addition, the smooth lining of a plaque may rupture, spilling cholesterol and other substances into your bloodstream",Arteriosclerosis/atherosclerosis
"This may cause a blood clot, which can block the blood flow to a specific part of your body, such as occurs when blocked blood flow to your heart causes a heart attack",Arteriosclerosis/atherosclerosis

"As the cataract grows larger, it clouds more of your lens and distorts the light passing through the lens",Cataracts
"This may lead to more noticeable symptoms",Cataracts
"If you develop sudden vision changes, such as double vision or flashes of light, sudden eye pain, or sudden headache, see your doctor right away",Cataracts
"Some inherited genetic disorders that cause other health problems can increase your risk of cataracts",Cataracts
"Cataracts can also be caused by other eye conditions, past eye surgery or medical conditions such as diabetes",Cataracts
"Long-term use of steroid medications, too, can cause cataracts to develop",Cataracts
"How a cataract forms The lens, where cataracts form, is positioned behind the colored part of your eye (iris)",Cataracts
"The lens focuses light that passes into your eye, producing clear, sharp images on the retina — the light-sensitive membrane in the eye that functions like the film in a camera",Cataracts
"As you age, the lenses in your eyes become less flexible, less transparent and thicker",Cataracts
"Age-related and other medical conditions cause tissues within the lens to break down and clump together, clouding small areas within the lens",Cataracts
"As the cataract continues to develop, the clouding becomes denser and involves a bigger part of the lens",Cataracts
"A cataract scatters and blocks the light as it passes through the lens, preventing a sharply defined image from reaching your retina",Cataracts
"As a result, your vision becomes blurred",Cataracts
"Cataracts generally develop in both eyes, but not evenly",Cataracts
"The cataract in one eye may be more advanced than the other, causing a difference in vision between eyes",Cataracts
"Types of cataracts Cataract types include: Cataracts affecting the center of the lens (nuclear cataracts)",Cataracts
"A nuclear cataract may at first cause more nearsightedness or even a temporary improvement in your reading vision",Cataracts
"But with time, the lens gradually turns more densely yellow and further clouds your vision",Cataracts
"As the cataract slowly progresses, the lens may even turn brown",Cataracts
"Advanced yellowing or browning of the lens can lead to difficulty distinguishing between shades of color",Cataracts
"Cataracts that affect the edges of the lens (cortical cataracts)",Cataracts
"A cortical cataract begins as whitish, wedge-shaped opacities or streaks on the outer edge of the lens cortex",Cataracts
"As it slowly progresses, the streaks extend to the center and interfere with light passing through the center of the lens",Cataracts
"Cataracts that affect the back of the lens (posterior subcapsular cataracts)",Cataracts
"A posterior subcapsular cataract starts as a small, opaque area that usually forms near the back of the lens, right in the path of light",Cataracts
"A posterior subcapsular cataract often interferes with your reading vision, reduces your vision in bright light, and causes glare or halos around lights at night",Cataracts
"These types of cataracts tend to progress faster than other types do",Cataracts
"Cataracts you're born with (congenital cataracts)",Cataracts
"Some people are born with cataracts or develop them during childhood",Cataracts
"These cataracts may be genetic, or associated with an intrauterine infection or trauma",Cataracts
"These cataracts also may be due to certain conditions, such as myotonic dystrophy, galactosemia, neurofibromatosis type 2 or rubella",Cataracts
"Congenital cataracts don't always affect vision, but if they do they're usually removed soon after detection",Cataracts

"If you develop any symptoms that may suggest heart valve disease, see your doctor",Heart valve disease
"Heart valve disease may be present at birth (congenital)",Heart valve disease
"It can also occur in adults due to many causes and conditions, such as infections and other heart conditions",Heart valve disease
"Heart valve problems may include: Regurgitation",Heart valve disease
"In this condition, the valve flaps don't close properly, causing blood to leak backward in your heart",Heart valve disease
"This commonly occurs due to valve flaps bulging back, a condition called prolapse",Heart valve disease
"Stenosis",Heart valve disease
"In valve stenosis, the valve flaps become thick or stiff, and they may fuse together",Heart valve disease
"This results in a narrowed valve opening and reduced blood flow through the valve",Heart valve disease
"Atresia",Heart valve disease
"In this condition, the valve isn't formed, and a solid sheet of tissue blocks the blood flow between the heart chambers",Heart valve disease
"In the first stage, you may experience flu-like signs and symptoms that may include: Fever and chills Headaches and muscle aches Vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain In its early stages, hantavirus infection is difficult to distinguish from influenza, pneumonia or other viral conditions",Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
"After four to 10 days, more-serious signs and symptoms begin",Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
"If you've been around rodents or rodent droppings and have signs and symptoms of fever, chills, muscle aches or any difficulties breathing, seek immediate medical attention",Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
"The deer mouse is the primary carrier of the virus responsible for most cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in North America",Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
"Other hantavirus carriers include the white-tailed mouse, cotton rat and rice rat",Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
"Inhalation: Main route of transmission Hantaviruses are transmitted to people primarily through the aerosolization of viruses shed in infected rodents' droppings, urine or saliva",Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
"Aerosolization occurs when a virus is kicked up into the air, making it easy for you to inhale",Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
"For example, a broom used to clean up mouse droppings in an attic may nudge into the air tiny particles of feces containing hantaviruses, which you can then easily inhale",Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
"After you inhale hantaviruses, they reach your lungs and begin to invade tiny blood vessels called capillaries, eventually causing them to leak",Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
"Your lungs then flood with fluid, which can trigger any of the respiratory problems associated with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome",Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
"Person-to-person transmission People who become infected with the North American strain of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome aren't contagious to other people",Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
"However, certain outbreaks in South America have shown evidence of being transmitted from person to person, which illustrates variation across strains in different regions",Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
"Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome also occurs in South America and Canada",Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
"Other hantaviruses occur in Asia, where they cause kidney disorders rather than lung problems",Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
"The chance of developing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is greater for people who work, live or play in spaces where rodents live",Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
"As the lungs fill with fluid, it becomes more and more difficult to breathe",Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
"Blood pressure drops and organs begin to fail, particularly the heart",Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
"Depending on the hantavirus strain, the mortality rate for the North American variety of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome can be more than 30 percent",Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
"Infants who have abdominal pain may pull their knees to their chests when they cry",Intussusception

"People sometimes have symptoms for weeks before seeking medical attention",Intussusception
"If you or your child develops the signs or symptoms listed above, seek medical help right away",Intussusception
"In infants, remember that signs of abdominal pain may include recurrent bouts of pulling the knees to the chest and crying",Intussusception
"In intussusception, one part of your intestine — usually the small intestine — slides inside an adjacent part",Intussusception
"This is sometimes called telescoping because it's similar to the way a collapsible telescope folds together",Intussusception
"In some cases, the telescoping is caused by an abnormal growth in the intestine, such as a polyp or a tumor (called a lead point)",Intussusception
"The normal wave-like contractions of the intestine grab this lead point and pull it and the lining of the intestine into the bowel ahead of it",Intussusception
"In most cases, however, no cause can be identified for intussusception",Intussusception
"Children In the vast majority of cases of intussusception in children, the cause is unknown",Intussusception
"Because intussusception seems to occur more often in the fall and winter and because many children with the problem also have flu-like symptoms, some suspect a virus may play a role in the condition",Intussusception
"Sometimes, a lead point can be identified as the cause of the condition — most frequently the lead point is a Meckel's diverticulum (a pouch in the lining of the small intestine)",Intussusception
"Children — especially young children — are much more likely to develop intussusception than adults are",Intussusception
"It's the most common cause of bowel obstruction in children between the ages of 6 months and 3 years",Intussusception
"Intussusception more often affects boys",Intussusception

"Once you've had intussusception, you're at increased risk of developing it again",Intussusception
"A family history",Intussusception
"Siblings of someone who's had an intussusception are at a much higher risk of the disorder",Intussusception
"If left untreated, lack of blood causes tissue of the intestinal wall to die",Intussusception
"Tissue death can lead to a tear (perforation) in the intestinal wall, which can cause an infection of the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritonitis)",Intussusception
"Peritonitis is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention",Intussusception
