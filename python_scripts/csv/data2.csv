"If you're with someone you suspect is having a stroke, watch the person carefully while waiting for emergency assistance",Stroke
"This deprives your brain of oxygen and nutrients, which can cause your brain cells to die",Stroke
"A stroke may be caused by a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or the leaking or bursting of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke)",Stroke
"Some people may experience only a temporary disruption of blood flow to their brain (transient ischemic attack, or TIA)",Stroke
"Ischemic stroke About 85 percent of strokes are ischemic strokes",Stroke
"Ischemic strokes occur when the arteries to your brain become narrowed or blocked, causing severely reduced blood flow (ischemia)",Stroke
"The most common ischemic strokes include: Thrombotic stroke",Stroke
"A thrombotic stroke occurs when a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one of the arteries that supply blood to your brain",Stroke
"A clot may be caused by fatty deposits (plaque) that build up in arteries and cause reduced blood flow (atherosclerosis) or other artery conditions",Stroke
"Embolic stroke",Stroke
"An embolic stroke occurs when a blood clot or other debris forms away from your brain — commonly in your heart — and is swept through your bloodstream to lodge in narrower brain arteries",Stroke
"This type of blood clot is called an embolus",Stroke
"Hemorrhagic stroke Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in your brain leaks or ruptures",Stroke
"Brain hemorrhages can result from many conditions that affect your blood vessels, including uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension), overtreatment with anticoagulants and weak spots in your blood vessel walls (aneurysms)",Stroke
"A less common cause of hemorrhage is the rupture of an abnormal tangle of thin-walled blood vessels (arteriovenous malformation) present at birth",Stroke
"Types of hemorrhagic stroke include: Intracerebral hemorrhage",Stroke
"In an intracerebral hemorrhage, a blood vessel in the brain bursts and spills into the surrounding brain tissue, damaging brain cells",Stroke
"Brain cells beyond the leak are deprived of blood and also damaged",Stroke
"High blood pressure, trauma, vascular malformations, use of blood-thinning medications and other conditions may cause an intracerebral hemorrhage",Stroke

"In a subarachnoid hemorrhage, an artery on or near the surface of your brain bursts and spills into the space between the surface of your brain and your skull",Stroke
"This bleeding is often signaled by a sudden, severe headache",Stroke
"A subarachnoid hemorrhage is commonly caused by the bursting of a small sack-shaped or berry-shaped outpouching on an artery known as an aneurysm",Stroke
"After the hemorrhage, the blood vessels in your brain may widen and narrow erratically (vasospasm), causing brain cell damage by further limiting blood flow",Stroke
"Ischemic stroke Ischemic stroke Transient ischemic attack (TIA) A transient ischemic attack (TIA) — also known as a ministroke — is a brief period of symptoms similar to those you'd have in a stroke",Stroke
"A temporary decrease in blood supply to part of your brain causes TIAs, which often last less than five minutes",Stroke
"Like an ischemic stroke, a TIA occurs when a clot or debris blocks blood flow to part of your brain",Stroke
"A TIA doesn't leave lasting symptoms because the blockage is temporary",Stroke
"Seek emergency care even if your symptoms seem to clear up",Stroke
"Having a TIA puts you at greater risk of having a full-blown stroke, causing permanent damage later",Stroke
"If you've had a TIA, it means there's likely a partially blocked or narrowed artery leading to your brain or a clot source in the heart",Stroke
"It's not possible to tell if you're having a stroke or a TIA based only on your symptoms",Stroke
"Up to half of people whose symptoms appear to go away actually have had a stroke causing brain damage",Stroke

"Nearly all cases of tetanus occur in people who have never been vaccinated or adults who haven't kept up with their 10-year booster shots",Tetanus
"You can't catch tetanus from a person who has it",Tetanus
"Complete recovery from a tetanus infection requires new nerve endings to grow, which can take up to several months",Tetanus
"After about a week, signs and symptoms include: Fever of 100",SARS
"If you have signs or symptoms of a respiratory infection, or if you have flu-like signs and symptoms with fever after traveling abroad, see your doctor right away",SARS
"Until now, these viruses have never been particularly dangerous in humans, although they can cause severe disease in animals",SARS
"For that reason, scientists originally thought that the SARS virus might have crossed from animals to humans",SARS
"It now seems likely that it evolved from one or more animal viruses into a new strain",SARS
"How SARS spreads Most respiratory illnesses, including SARS, spread through droplets that enter the air when someone with the disease coughs, sneezes or talks",SARS
"Most experts think SARS spreads mainly through face-to-face contact, but the virus may also be spread on contaminated objects — such as doorknobs, telephones and elevator buttons",SARS
"Breathing problems can become so severe that a mechanical respirator is required",SARS
"SARS is fatal in some cases, often due to respiratory failure",SARS
"Other possible complications include heart and liver failure",SARS
"People older than the age of 60 — especially those with underlying conditions such as diabetes or hepatitis — are at highest risk of serious complications",SARS
"As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders",Rheumatoid arthritis
"In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body",Rheumatoid arthritis
"About 40 percent of the people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don't involve the joints",Rheumatoid arthritis
"Rheumatoid arthritis can affect many nonjoint structures, including: Skin Eyes Lungs Heart Kidneys Salivary glands Nerve tissue Bone marrow Blood vessels Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go",Rheumatoid arthritis
"Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission — when the swelling and pain fade or disappear",Rheumatoid arthritis
"Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place",Rheumatoid arthritis
"osteoarthritis Rheumatoid arthritis vs",Rheumatoid arthritis
"osteoarthritis Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system attacks the synovium — the lining of the membranes that surround your joints",Rheumatoid arthritis
"The resulting inflammation thickens the synovium, which can eventually destroy the cartilage and bone within the joint",Rheumatoid arthritis
"The tendons and ligaments that hold the joint together weaken and stretch",Rheumatoid arthritis
"Gradually, the joint loses its shape and alignment",Rheumatoid arthritis
"Doctors don't know what starts this process, although a genetic component appears likely",Rheumatoid arthritis
"While your genes don't actually cause rheumatoid arthritis, they can make you more susceptible to environmental factors — such as infection with certain viruses and bacteria — that may trigger the disease",Rheumatoid arthritis
"Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis",Rheumatoid arthritis
"Rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins between the ages of 40 and 60",Rheumatoid arthritis
"Family history",Rheumatoid arthritis
"If a member of your family has rheumatoid arthritis, you may have an increased risk of the disease",Rheumatoid arthritis
"Cigarette smoking increases your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, particularly if you have a genetic predisposition for developing the disease",Rheumatoid arthritis
"Smoking also appears to be associated with greater disease severity",Rheumatoid arthritis
"Environmental exposures",Rheumatoid arthritis
"Although uncertain and poorly understood, some exposures such as asbestos or silica may increase the risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis",Rheumatoid arthritis
"Emergency workers exposed to dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center are at higher risk of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis",Rheumatoid arthritis
"Obesity",Rheumatoid arthritis
"People who are overweight or obese appear to be at somewhat higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, especially in women diagnosed with the disease when they were 55 or younger",Rheumatoid arthritis
"Signs and symptoms may include: Redness Itching or pain Tiny bumps that may merge into raised patches Scaling, crusting or bleeding Blisters or hives Signs and symptoms usually occur only on skin that has been exposed to the sun and typically develop within minutes to hours after sun exposure",Sun allergy
"For severe or persistent symptoms, you may need to see a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating skin disorders (dermatologist)",Sun allergy
"Primary infection (Acute HIV) The majority of people infected by HIV develop a flu-like illness within a month or two after the virus enters the body",HIV/AIDS
"This illness, known as primary or acute HIV infection, may last for a few weeks",HIV/AIDS
"Possible signs and symptoms include: Fever Headache Muscle aches and joint pain Rash Sore throat Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck Although the symptoms of primary HIV infection may be mild enough to go unnoticed, the amount of virus in the bloodstream (viral load) is particularly high at this time",HIV/AIDS
"As a result, HIV infection spreads more efficiently during primary infection than during the next stage of infection",HIV/AIDS
"Clinical latent infection (Chronic HIV) In some people, persistent swelling of lymph nodes occurs during clinical latent HIV",HIV/AIDS
"Otherwise, there are no specific signs and symptoms",HIV/AIDS
"HIV remains in the body, however, and in infected white blood cells",HIV/AIDS
"Clinical latent infection generally lasts around 10 years if you're not receiving antiretroviral therapy",HIV/AIDS
"This phase can last for decades in people taking antiretroviral medications",HIV/AIDS
"But some people progress to more severe disease much sooner",HIV/AIDS
"Early symptomatic HIV infection As the virus continues to multiply and destroy immune cells, you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as: Fever Fatigue Swollen lymph nodes — often one of the first signs of HIV infection Diarrhea Weight loss Oral yeast infection (thrush) Shingles (herpes zoster) Progression to AIDS If you receive no treatment for your HIV infection, the disease typically progresses to AIDS in about 10 years",HIV/AIDS
"By the time AIDS develops, your immune system has been severely damaged, making you susceptible to opportunistic infections — diseases that wouldn't usually trouble a person with a healthy immune system",HIV/AIDS
"If you don't have any signs or symptoms, but are worried about your risk of cancer, discuss your concerns with your doctor",Cancer
"Ask about which cancer screening tests and procedures are appropriate for you",Cancer
"For this reason, doctors make a distinction between: Latent TB",Tuberculosis
"In this condition, you have a TB infection, but the bacteria remain in your body in an inactive state and cause no symptoms",Tuberculosis
"Latent TB, also called inactive TB or TB infection, isn't contagious",Tuberculosis
"It can turn into active TB, so treatment is important for the person with latent TB and to help control the spread of TB",Tuberculosis
"An estimated 2 billion people have latent TB",Tuberculosis
"Active TB",Tuberculosis
"This condition makes you sick and can spread to others",Tuberculosis
"It can occur in the first few weeks after infection with the TB bacteria, or it might occur years later",Tuberculosis
"Signs and symptoms of active TB include: Coughing that lasts three or more weeks Coughing up blood Chest pain, or pain with breathing or coughing Unintentional weight loss Fatigue Fever Night sweats Chills Loss of appetite Tuberculosis can also affect other parts of your body, including your kidneys, spine or brain",Tuberculosis
"When TB occurs outside your lungs, signs and symptoms vary according to the organs involved",Tuberculosis
"For example, tuberculosis of the spine may give you back pain, and tuberculosis in your kidneys might cause blood in your urine",Tuberculosis
"These are often signs of TB, but they can also result from other medical problems",Tuberculosis
"Your doctor can perform tests to help determine the cause",Tuberculosis
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people who have an increased risk of tuberculosis be screened for latent TB infection",Tuberculosis
"This can happen when someone with the untreated, active form of tuberculosis coughs, speaks, sneezes, spits, laughs or sings",Tuberculosis
"Although tuberculosis is contagious, it's not easy to catch",Tuberculosis
"You're much more likely to get tuberculosis from someone you live with or work with than from a stranger",Tuberculosis
"Most people with active TB who've had appropriate drug treatment for at least two weeks are no longer contagious",Tuberculosis
"HIV and TB Since the 1980s, the number of cases of tuberculosis has increased dramatically because of the spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS",Tuberculosis
"Infection with HIV suppresses the immune system, making it difficult for the body to control TB bacteria",Tuberculosis
"As a result, people with HIV are many times more likely to get TB and to progress from latent to active disease than are people who aren't HIV positive",Tuberculosis
"Drug-resistant TB Another reason tuberculosis remains a major killer is the increase in drug-resistant strains of the bacterium",Tuberculosis
"Since the first antibiotics were used to fight tuberculosis more than 60 years ago, some TB germs have developed the ability to survive, and that ability gets passed on to their descendants",Tuberculosis
"Drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis emerge when an antibiotic fails to kill all of the bacteria it targets",Tuberculosis
"The surviving bacteria become resistant to that particular drug and frequently other antibiotics as well",Tuberculosis
"Some TB bacteria have developed resistance to the most commonly used treatments, such as isoniazid and rifampin",Tuberculosis
"Some strains of TB have also developed resistance to drugs less commonly used in TB treatment, such as the antibiotics known as fluoroquinolones, and injectable medications including amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin",Tuberculosis
"These medications are often used to treat infections that are resistant to the more commonly used drugs",Tuberculosis
"These factors include: Weakened immune system A healthy immune system often successfully fights TB bacteria, but your body can't mount an effective defense if your resistance is low",Tuberculosis
"A number of diseases and medications can weaken your immune system, including: HIV/AIDS Diabetes Severe kidney disease Certain cancers Cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy Drugs to prevent rejection of transplanted organs Some drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and psoriasis Malnutrition Very young or advanced age Traveling or living in certain areas The risk of contracting tuberculosis is higher for people who live in or travel to countries that have high rates of tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis, including: Africa Eastern Europe Asia Russia Latin America Caribbean Islands Poverty and substance abuse Lack of medical care",Tuberculosis
"If you receive a low or fixed income, live in a remote area, have recently immigrated to the United States, or are homeless, you may lack access to the medical care needed to diagnose and treat TB",Tuberculosis
"Substance abuse",Tuberculosis
"IV drug use or alcohol abuse weakens your immune system and makes you more vulnerable to tuberculosis",Tuberculosis
"Tobacco use",Tuberculosis
"Using tobacco greatly increases the risk of getting TB and dying of it",Tuberculosis
"Where you work or live Health care work",Tuberculosis
"Regular contact with people who are ill increases your chances of exposure to TB bacteria",Tuberculosis
"Wearing a mask and frequent hand-washing greatly reduce your risk",Tuberculosis
"Living or working in a residential care facility",Tuberculosis
"People who live or work in prisons, immigration centers or nursing homes are all at a higher risk of tuberculosis",Tuberculosis
"That's because the risk of the disease is higher anywhere there is overcrowding and poor ventilation",Tuberculosis
"Living in a refugee camp or shelter",Tuberculosis
"Weakened by poor nutrition and ill health and living in crowded, unsanitary conditions, refugees are at especially high risk of tuberculosis infection",Tuberculosis
"Untreated active disease typically affects your lungs, but it can spread to other parts of your body through your bloodstream",Tuberculosis
"Examples of tuberculosis complications include:",Tuberculosis
"Migraine aura usually occurs within an hour before head pain begins and generally lasts less than 60 minutes",Migraine with aura
"Sometimes migraine aura occurs with little or no headache, especially in people age 50 and older",Migraine with aura
"Visual signs and symptoms Most people who experience migraine with aura develop temporary visual signs and symptoms of aura",Migraine with aura
"These may include: Blind spots (scotomas), which are sometimes outlined by simple geometric designs Zigzag lines that gradually float across your field of vision Shimmering spots or stars Changes in vision or vision loss Flashes of light These types of visual disturbances tend to start in the center of your field of vision and spread outward",Migraine with aura
"Your doctor will need to rule out more-serious conditions, such as a stroke or retinal tear",Migraine with aura
"Once these conditions are ruled out, you won't need to see your doctor about future migraines unless your symptoms change",Migraine with aura
"It's believed that the migraine with visual aura is like an electrical or chemical wave that moves across the part of your brain that processes visual signals (visual cortex) and causes these visual hallucinations",Migraine with aura
"Many of the same factors that trigger migraine can also trigger migraine with aura, including stress, bright lights, some foods and medications, too much or too little sleep, and menstruation",Migraine with aura
"Migraines are also more common in women than men",Migraine with aura
"Women who have migraine with aura appear to have an even higher risk of stroke if they smoke or take birth control pills",Migraine with aura
"Advanced-stage ovarian cancer may cause few and nonspecific symptoms that are often mistaken for more common benign conditions, such as constipation or irritable bowel",Ovarian cancer
"If you have a family history of ovarian cancer or breast cancer, talk to your doctor about your risk of ovarian cancer",Ovarian cancer
"Your doctor may refer you to a genetic counselor to discuss testing for certain gene mutations that increase your risk of breast and ovarian cancers",Ovarian cancer
"Only a small number of women are found to have genetic mutations that can lead to ovarian cancer",Ovarian cancer
"Signs and symptoms may come on suddenly or develop slowly, may be mild or severe, and may be temporary or permanent",Lupus
"Most people with lupus have mild disease characterized by episodes — called flares — when signs and symptoms get worse for a while, then improve or even disappear completely for a time",Lupus
"The signs and symptoms of lupus that you experience will depend on which body systems are affected by the disease",Lupus
"Many conditions can cause these symptoms, so your doctor may check for these conditions as well as for pancreatic cancer",Pancreatic cancer
"Doctors have identified factors, such as smoking, that increase your risk of developing the disease",Pancreatic cancer
"Understanding your pancreas Your pancreas is about 6 inches (15 centimeters) long and looks something like a pear lying on its side",Pancreatic cancer
"It releases (secretes) hormones, including insulin, to help your body process sugar in the foods you eat",Pancreatic cancer
"And it produces digestive juices to help your body digest food",Pancreatic cancer
"How pancreatic cancer forms Pancreatic cancer occurs when cells in your pancreas develop mutations in their DNA",Pancreatic cancer
"These mutations cause cells to grow uncontrollably and to continue living after normal cells would die",Pancreatic cancer
"These accumulating cells can form a tumor",Pancreatic cancer
"Untreated pancreatic cancer spreads to nearby organs and blood vessels",Pancreatic cancer
"Most pancreatic cancer begins in the cells that line the ducts of the pancreas",Pancreatic cancer
"This type of cancer is called pancreatic adenocarcinoma or pancreatic exocrine cancer",Pancreatic cancer
"Rarely, cancer can form in the hormone-producing cells or the neuroendocrine cells of the pancreas",Pancreatic cancer
"These types of cancer are called islet cell tumors, pancreatic endocrine cancer and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors",Pancreatic cancer
"In infants, the rash is mainly found on the neck, shoulders and chest",Heat rash
"It can also show up in the armpits, elbow creases and groin",Heat rash
"Types of heat rash The types of miliaria are classified according to how deep the blocked sweat ducts are",Heat rash
"Signs and symptoms for each type vary",Heat rash
"The mildest form of heat rash (miliaria crystallina ) affects the sweat ducts in the top layer of skin",Heat rash
"This form is marked by clear, fluid-filled blisters and bumps (papules) that break easily",Heat rash
"affects the sweat ducts in the top layer of skin",Heat rash
"A type that occurs deeper in the skin (miliaria rubra) is sometimes called prickly heat",Heat rash
"Signs and symptoms include red bumps and itching or prickling in the affected area",Heat rash
"Occasionally, the fluid-containing sacs (vesicles) of miliaria rubra become inflamed and pus-filled (pustular)",Heat rash
"This form is called miliaria pustulosa",Heat rash
"A less common form of heat rash (miliaria profunda) affects the dermis, a deeper layer of skin",Heat rash
"Retained sweat leaks out of the sweat gland into the skin, causing firm, flesh-colored lesions that resemble goose bumps",Heat rash
"See your doctor if you or your child has symptoms that last longer than a few days, the rash seems to be getting worse, or you notice signs of infection, such as: Increased pain, swelling, redness or warmth around the affected area Pus draining from the lesions Swollen lymph nodes in the armpit, neck or groin A fever or chills  ",Heat rash
"Your doctor will likely investigate more common causes of these signs and symptoms first",Stomach cancer
"There is a strong correlation between a diet high in smoked and salted foods and stomach cancer",Stomach cancer
"As the use of refrigeration for preserving foods has increased around the world, the rates of stomach cancer have declined",Stomach cancer
"In general, cancer begins when an error (mutation) occurs in a cell's DNA",Stomach cancer
"The mutation causes the cell to grow and divide at a rapid rate and to continue living when a normal cell would die",Stomach cancer
"The accumulating cancerous cells form a tumor that can invade nearby structures",Stomach cancer
"And cancer cells can break off from the tumor to spread throughout the body",Stomach cancer
"Types of stomach cancer The cells that form the tumor determine the type of stomach cancer",Stomach cancer
"The type of cells in your stomach cancer helps determine your treatment options",Stomach cancer
"Types of stomach cancer include: Cancer that begins in the glandular cells (adenocarcinoma)",Stomach cancer
"The glandular cells that line the inside of the stomach secrete a protective layer of mucus to shield the lining of the stomach from the acidic digestive juices",Stomach cancer
"Adenocarcinoma accounts for the great majority of all stomach cancers",Stomach cancer
"Cancer that begins in immune system cells (lymphoma)",Stomach cancer
"The walls of the stomach contain a small number of immune system cells that can develop cancer",Stomach cancer
"Lymphoma in the stomach is rare",Stomach cancer
"Cancer that begins in hormone-producing cells (carcinoid cancer)",Stomach cancer
"Hormone-producing cells can develop carcinoid cancer",Stomach cancer
"Carcinoid cancer in the stomach is rare",Stomach cancer
"Cancer that begins in nervous system tissues",Stomach cancer
"A gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) begins in specific nervous system cells found in your stomach",Stomach cancer
"GIST is a rare form of stomach cancer",Stomach cancer
"Because the other types of stomach cancer are rare, when people use the term stomach cancer they generally are referring to adenocarcinoma",Stomach cancer
"Though almost any part of your body may be involved, in adults and older children scabies is most often found: Between fingers In armpits Around your waist Along the insides of wrists On your inner elbow On the soles of your feet Around breasts Around the male genital area On buttocks On knees On shoulder blades In infants and young children, common sites of infestation include the: Scalp Face Neck Palms of the hands Soles of the feet If you've had scabies before, signs and symptoms may develop within a few days of exposure",Scabies
"However, if you've never had scabies, it could take as long as six weeks for signs and symptoms to begin",Scabies
"It's important to remember that you can still spread scabies even if you don't have any signs or symptoms yet",Scabies
"Many skin conditions, such as dermatitis or eczema, are associated with itching and small bumps on the skin",Scabies
"Your doctor can help determine the exact cause and ensure that you receive proper treatment",Scabies
"Bathing and over-the-counter preparations won't eliminate scabies",Scabies
"Rarely, an allergic reaction to soy can be frightening and even life-threatening",Soy allergy
"Signs and symptoms of a food allergy usually develop within a few minutes to hours after eating a food containing the allergen",Soy allergy
"Soy allergy symptoms can include: Tingling in the mouth Hives; itching; or itchy, scaly skin (eczema) Swelling of lips, face, tongue and throat, or other body parts Wheezing, runny nose or breathing difficulty Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting Skin redness (flushing) A severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) is rare with a soy allergy",Soy allergy

"The gonorrhea bacteria are most often passed from one person to another during sexual contact, including oral, anal or vaginal intercourse",Gonorrhea
"But colds usually develop slowly, whereas the flu tends to come on suddenly",Influenza
"And although a cold can be a nuisance, you usually feel much worse with the flu",Influenza
"Common signs and symptoms of the flu include: Fever over 100",Influenza
"If you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your doctor right away",Influenza
"Taking antiviral drugs within the first 48 hours after you first notice symptoms may reduce the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems",Influenza
"You can inhale the droplets directly, or you can pick up the germs from an object — such as a telephone or computer keyboard — and then transfer them to your eyes, nose or mouth",Influenza
"People with the virus are likely contagious from the day or so before symptoms first appear until about five days after symptoms begin, though sometimes people are contagious for as long as 10 days after symptoms appear",Influenza
"Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time",Influenza
"Influenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing regularly",Influenza
"If you've had influenza in the past, your body has already made antibodies to fight that particular strain of the virus",Influenza
"If future influenza viruses are similar to those you've encountered before, either by having the disease or by vaccination, those antibodies may prevent infection or lessen its severity",Influenza
"But antibodies against flu viruses you've encountered in the past can't protect you from new influenza subtypes that can be very different immunologically from what you had before",Influenza
"Seasonal influenza tends to target young children and older adults",Influenza
"Living conditions",Influenza
"People who live in facilities along with many other residents, such as nursing homes or military barracks, are more likely to develop influenza",Influenza
"Cancer treatments, anti-rejection drugs, corticosteroids and HIV/AIDS can weaken your immune system",Influenza
"This can make it easier for you to catch influenza and may also increase your risk of developing complications",Influenza
"Chronic illnesses",Influenza
"Chronic conditions, such as asthma, diabetes or heart problems, may increase your risk of influenza complications",Influenza
"Pregnant women are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters",Influenza
"Women who are two weeks postpartum are also more likely to develop influenza-related complications",Influenza
"People with a BMI of 40 or more have an increased risk of complications from the flu",Influenza

"For older adults and people with a chronic illness, pneumonia can be deadly",Influenza
"Yet because they shed cholera bacteria in their stool for seven to 14 days, they can still infect others through contaminated water",Cholera
"Most symptomatic cases of cholera cause mild or moderate diarrhea that's often hard to distinguish from diarrhea caused by other problems",Cholera
"Only about 1 in 10 infected people develops more-serious signs and symptoms of cholera, usually within a few days of infection",Cholera
"Cholera-related diarrhea comes on suddenly and may quickly cause dangerous fluid loss — as much as a quart (about 1 liter) an hour",Cholera
"Diarrhea due to cholera often has a pale, milky appearance that resembles water in which rice has been rinsed (rice-water stool)",Cholera
"Nausea and vomiting",Cholera
"Occurring especially in the early stages of cholera, vomiting may persist for hours at a time",Cholera
"Dehydration",Cholera
"Dehydration can develop within hours after the onset of cholera symptoms",Cholera
"Depending on how many body fluids have been lost, dehydration can range from mild to severe",Cholera
"A loss of 10 percent or more of total body weight indicates severe dehydration",Cholera
"Signs and symptoms of cholera dehydration include irritability, lethargy, sunken eyes, a dry mouth, extreme thirst, dry and shriveled skin that's slow to bounce back when pinched into a fold, little or no urine output, low blood pressure, and an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)",Cholera
"Dehydration may lead to a rapid loss of minerals in your blood (electrolytes) that maintain the balance of fluids in your body",Cholera
"This is called an electrolyte imbalance",Cholera
"Electrolyte imbalance An electrolyte imbalance can lead to serious signs and symptoms such as: Muscle cramps",Cholera
"These result from the rapid loss of salts such as sodium, chloride and potassium",Cholera
"Shock",Cholera
"This is one of the most serious complications of dehydration",Cholera
"It occurs when low blood volume causes a drop in blood pressure and a drop in the amount of oxygen in your body",Cholera
"If untreated, severe hypovolemic shock can cause death in a matter of minutes",Cholera
"Still, sporadic cases of cholera occur throughout the world",Cholera
"If you develop severe diarrhea after visiting an area with active cholera, see your doctor",Cholera
"If you have diarrhea, especially severe diarrhea, and think you may have been exposed to cholera, seek treatment right away",Cholera
"Severe dehydration is a medical emergency that requires immediate care regardless of the cause",Cholera
"However, the deadly effects of the disease are the result of a potent toxin called CTX that the bacterium produce in the small intestine",Cholera
"CTX binds to the intestinal walls, where it interferes with the normal flow of sodium and chloride",Cholera
"This causes the body to secrete enormous amounts of water, leading to diarrhea and a rapid loss of fluids and salts (electrolytes)",Cholera
"Contaminated water supplies are the main source of cholera infection, although raw shellfish, uncooked fruits and vegetables, and other foods also can harbor V",Cholera
"cholerae",Cholera
"Cholera bacteria have two distinct life cycles — one in the environment and one in humans",Cholera
"Cholera bacteria in the environment Cholera bacteria occur naturally in coastal waters, where they attach to tiny crustaceans called copepods",Cholera
"The cholera bacteria travel with their hosts, spreading worldwide as the crustaceans follow their food source — certain types of algae and plankton that grow explosively when water temperatures rise",Cholera
"Algae growth is further fueled by the urea found in sewage and in agricultural runoff",Cholera
"Cholera bacteria in people When humans ingest cholera bacteria, they may not become sick themselves, but they still pass the bacteria in their stool",Cholera
"When human feces contaminate food and water supplies, both can serve as ideal breeding grounds for the cholera bacteria",Cholera
"Because more than a million cholera bacteria — approximately the amount you'd find in a glass of contaminated water — are needed to cause illness, cholera usually isn't transmitted through casual person-to-person contact",Cholera
"The most common sources of cholera infection are standing water and certain types of food, including seafood, raw fruits and vegetables, and grains",Cholera
"Surface or well water",Cholera
"Cholera bacteria can lie dormant in water for long periods, and contaminated public wells are frequent sources of large-scale cholera outbreaks",Cholera
"People living in crowded conditions without adequate sanitation are especially at risk of cholera",Cholera
"Seafood",Cholera
"Eating raw or undercooked seafood, especially shellfish, that originates from certain locations can expose you to cholera bacteria",Cholera
"Most recent cases of cholera occurring in the United States have been traced to seafood from the Gulf of Mexico",Cholera
"Raw fruits and vegetables",Cholera
"Raw, unpeeled fruits and vegetables are a frequent source of cholera infection in areas where cholera is endemic",Cholera
"In developing nations, uncomposted manure fertilizers or irrigation water containing raw sewage can contaminate produce in the field",Cholera
"Grains",Cholera
"In regions where cholera is widespread, grains such as rice and millet that are contaminated after cooking and allowed to remain at room temperature for several hours become a medium for the growth of cholera bacteria",Cholera
"Still, certain factors can make you more vulnerable to the disease or more likely to experience severe signs and symptoms",Cholera
"Cholera is more likely to flourish in situations where a sanitary environment — including a safe water supply — is difficult to maintain",Cholera
"Such conditions are common to refugee camps, impoverished countries, and areas devastated by famine, war or natural disasters",Cholera
"Reduced or nonexistent stomach acid (hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria)",Cholera
"Cholera bacteria can't survive in an acidic environment, and ordinary stomach acid often serves as a first line defense against infection",Cholera
"But people with low levels of stomach acid — such as children, older adults, and people who take antacids, H-2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors — lack this protection, so they're at greater risk of cholera",Cholera
"Household exposure",Cholera
"You're at significantly increased risk of cholera if you live with someone who has the disease",Cholera
"Type O blood",Cholera
"For reasons that aren't entirely clear, people with type O blood are twice as likely to develop cholera compared with people with other blood types",Cholera
"Raw or undercooked shellfish",Cholera
"Although large-scale cholera outbreaks no longer occur in industrialized nations, eating shellfish from waters known to harbor the bacteria greatly increases your risk",Cholera
"In the most severe cases, the rapid loss of large amounts of fluids and electrolytes can lead to death within two to three hours",Cholera
"In less extreme situations, people who don't receive treatment may die of dehydration and shock hours to days after cholera symptoms first appear",Cholera
"Although shock and severe dehydration are the most devastating complications of cholera, other problems can occur, such as:",Cholera
"Signs and symptoms of a boil usually include: A painful, red bump that starts out about the size of a pea Red, swollen skin around the bump An increase in the size of the bump over a few days as it fills with pus (can sometimes reach the size of a baseball) Development of a yellow-white tip that eventually ruptures and allows the pus to drain out Carbuncles A carbuncle is a cluster of boils that form a connected area of infection",Boils and carbuncles
"Carbuncles often occur on the back of the neck, shoulders or thighs",Boils and carbuncles
"Compared with single boils, carbuncles cause a deeper and more severe infection and are more likely to leave a scar",Boils and carbuncles
"People who have a carbuncle often feel unwell in general and may experience a fever and chills",Boils and carbuncles
"Boils sometimes develop at sites where the skin has been broken by a small injury or an insect bite, which gives the bacteria easy entry",Boils and carbuncles
"You're more likely to develop an infection if you live with someone who has a boil or carbuncle",Boils and carbuncles
"This disease can make it more difficult for your body to fight infection, including bacterial infections of your skin",Boils and carbuncles
"Other skin conditions",Boils and carbuncles
"Because they damage your skin's protective barrier, skin problems, such as acne and eczema, make you more susceptible to boils and carbuncles",Boils and carbuncles
"Compromised immunity",Boils and carbuncles
"If your immune system is weakened for any reason, you're more susceptible to boils and carbuncles",Boils and carbuncles

"However, the more signs and symptoms you have, the greater the likelihood you're having a heart attack",Heart attack
"Some heart attacks strike suddenly, but many people have warning signs and symptoms hours, days or weeks in advance",Heart attack
"The earliest warning may be recurrent chest pain (angina) that's triggered by exertion and relieved by rest",Heart attack
"Angina is caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to the heart",Heart attack
"A heart attack differs from a condition in which your heart suddenly stops (sudden cardiac arrest, which occurs when an electrical disturbance disrupts your heart's pumping action and causes blood to stop flowing to the rest of your body)",Heart attack
"A heart attack can cause cardiac arrest, but it's not the only cause",Heart attack

"Incubating nits may be difficult to see because they're very tiny and camouflaged to match hair color",Head lice infestation
"They're easiest to spot around the ears and the hairline of the neck",Head lice infestation
"Empty nits may be easier to spot because they're lighter in color and further from the scalp",Head lice infestation
"However, the presence of nits doesn't necessarily indicate an active infestation",Head lice infestation
"Studies show that many children have been treated for head lice with over-the-counter medications or home remedies when they don't have an active head lice infestation",Head lice infestation
"Things often mistaken for nits include: Dead or empty nits from a previous head lice infestation Dandruff Residue from hair products Bead of dead hair tissue on a hair shaft (hair cast) Scab tissue, dirt or other debris Other small insects found in the hair  ",Head lice infestation

"Guidelines generally recommend that colon cancer screenings begin at age 50",Colon cancer
"Your doctor may recommend more frequent or earlier screening if you have other risk factors, such as a family history of the disease",Colon cancer
"Doctors know that colon cancer occurs when healthy cells in the colon develop errors in their DNA",Colon cancer
"Healthy cells grow and divide in an orderly way to keep your body functioning normally",Colon cancer
"But when a cell's DNA is damaged and becomes cancerous, cells continue to divide — even when new cells aren't needed",Colon cancer

"Association between diet and increased colon cancer risk Studies of large groups of people have shown an association between a typical Western diet and an increased risk of colon cancer",Colon cancer
"A typical Western diet is high in fat and low in fiber",Colon cancer
"When people move from areas where the typical diet is low in fat and high in fiber to areas where the typical Western diet is most common, the risk of colon cancer in these people increases significantly",Colon cancer
"It's not clear why this occurs, but researchers are studying whether a high-fat, low-fiber diet affects the microbes that live in the colon or causes underlying inflammation that may contribute to cancer risk",Colon cancer

"However, it's possible — and even somewhat more likely — to have chronic sinusitis without nasal polyps",Nasal polyps
"Nasal polyps themselves are soft and lack sensation, so if they're small you may not be aware you have them",Nasal polyps
"Multiple growths or a large polyp may block your nasal passages and sinuses",Nasal polyps
"It's not clear why some people develop chronic inflammation or why ongoing inflammation triggers polyp formation in some people and not in others",Nasal polyps
"The inflammation occurs in the fluid-producing lining (mucous membrane) of your nose and sinuses",Nasal polyps
"There's some evidence that people who develop polyps have a different immune system response and different chemical markers in their mucous membranes than do those who don't develop polyps",Nasal polyps
"Nasal polyps can form at any age, but they're most common in young and middle-aged adults",Nasal polyps
"Nasal polyps may form anywhere in your sinuses or nasal passages, but they appear most often in an area where sinuses near your eyes, nose and cheekbones all drain through winding passages into your nose (ostiomeatal complex)",Nasal polyps
"Conditions often associated with nasal polyps include: Asthma, a disease that causes overall airway inflammation and constriction a disease that causes overall airway inflammation and constriction Aspirin sensitivity may cause some people to be more likely to develop nasal polyps may cause some people to be more likely to develop nasal polyps Allergic fungal sinusitis, an allergy to airborne fungi an allergy to airborne fungi Cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that results in the production and secretion of abnormally thick, sticky fluids, including thick mucus from nasal and sinus membranes a genetic disorder that results in the production and secretion of abnormally thick, sticky fluids, including thick mucus from nasal and sinus membranes Churg-Strauss syndrome, a rare disease that causes the inflammation of blood vessels Your family history also may play a role",Nasal polyps

"Most people experience migraines without aura",Migraine
"Auras are symptoms of the nervous system",Migraine
"They are usually visual disturbances, such as flashes of light or wavy, zigzag vision",Migraine
"Sometimes auras can also be touching sensations (sensory), movement (motor) or speech (verbal) disturbances",Migraine

"If you regularly experience signs and symptoms of migraine attacks, keep a record of your attacks and how you treated them",Migraine
"Then make an appointment with your doctor to discuss your headaches",Migraine
"Migraines may be caused by changes in the brainstem and its interactions with the trigeminal nerve, a major pain pathway",Migraine
"Imbalances in brain chemicals — including serotonin, which helps regulate pain in your nervous system — also may be involved",Migraine
"Researchers are still studying the role of serotonin in migraines",Migraine
"Serotonin levels drop during migraine attacks",Migraine
"This may cause your trigeminal nerve to release substances called neuropeptides, which travel to your brain's outer covering (meninges)",Migraine
"The result is migraine pain",Migraine
"Other neurotransmitters play a role in the pain of migraine, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)",Migraine
"Migraine triggers A number of factors may trigger migraines, including: Hormonal changes in women",Migraine
"Fluctuations in estrogen seem to trigger headaches in many women",Migraine
"Women with a history of migraines often report headaches immediately before or during their periods, when they have a major drop in estrogen",Migraine
"Others have an increased tendency to develop migraines during pregnancy or menopause",Migraine
"Hormonal medications, such as oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, also may worsen migraines",Migraine
"Some women, however, find their migraines occur less often when taking these medications",Migraine
"Foods",Migraine
"Aged cheeses, salty foods and processed foods may trigger migraines",Migraine

"Oral contraceptives and vasodilators, such as nitroglycerin, can aggravate migraines",Migraine
"If you have a family member with migraines, then you have a good chance of developing them too",Migraine
"Migraines can begin at any age, though the first often occurs during adolescence",Migraine
"Migraines tend to peak during your 30s, and gradually become less severe and less frequent in the following decades",Migraine

"Migraines often return during the postpartum period",Migraine
"Certain pain relievers called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), may cause abdominal pain, bleeding, ulcers and other complications, especially if taken in large doses or for a long period of time",Migraine
"Medication-overuse headaches",Migraine
"Taking over-the-counter or prescription headache medications more than 10 days a month for three months or in high doses may trigger serious medication-overuse headaches",Migraine
"Medication-overuse headaches occur when medications stop relieving pain and begin to cause headaches",Migraine
"You then use more pain medication, which continues the cycle",Migraine
"Serotonin syndrome",Migraine
"Serotonin syndrome is a rare, potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when your body has too much of the nervous system chemical called serotonin",Migraine
"While the risk is considered extremely low, taking migraine medications called triptans and antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome",Migraine
"These medications naturally raise serotonin levels, and it is possible that combining them could cause levels that are too high",Migraine
"Triptans and SSRIs or SNRIs may be used together, but it's important to watch out for possible symptoms of serotonin syndrome such as changes in cognition, behavior and muscle control (such as involuntary jerking)",Migraine
"Triptans include medications such as sumatriptan (Imitrex) or zolmitriptan (Zomig)",Migraine
"Some common SSRIs include sertraline (Zoloft), fluoxetine (Sarafem, Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil)",Migraine

"Food poisoning Staph bacteria are one of the most common causes of food poisoning",Staph infections
"A staph infection in food usually doesn't cause a fever",Staph infections
"Signs and symptoms you can expect with this type of staph infection include: Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Dehydration Low blood pressure Bacteremia Also known as blood poisoning, bacteremia occurs when staph bacteria enter a person's bloodstream",Staph infections
"A fever and low blood pressure are signs of bacteremia",Staph infections
"The bacteria can travel to locations deep within your body, to produce infections affecting: Internal organs, such as your brain, heart or lungs Bones and muscles Surgically implanted devices, such as artificial joints or cardiac pacemakers Toxic shock syndrome This life-threatening condition results from toxins produced by some strains of staph bacteria and has been linked to the use of certain types of tampons, skin wounds and surgery",Staph infections

"Seek immediate medical attention if you experience typical kidney infection symptoms combined with bloody urine or nausea and vomiting",Kidney infection
"Many people, particularly older adults, don't feel thirsty until they're already dehydrated",Dehydration
"That's why it's important to increase water intake during hot weather or when you're ill",Dehydration
"The signs and symptoms of dehydration also may differ by age",Dehydration
"Other dehydration causes include: Diarrhea, vomiting",Dehydration
"Severe, acute diarrhea — that is, diarrhea that comes on suddenly and violently — can cause a tremendous loss of water and electrolytes in a short amount of time",Dehydration

"If you do vigorous activity and don't replace fluids as you go along, you can become dehydrated",Dehydration
"Hot, humid weather increases the amount you sweat and the amount of fluid you lose",Dehydration
"Increased urination",Dehydration
"This may be due to undiagnosed or uncontrolled diabetes",Dehydration
"Certain medications, such as diuretics and some blood pressure medications, also can lead to dehydration, generally because they cause you to urinate more",Dehydration
"The most likely group to experience severe diarrhea and vomiting, infants and children are especially vulnerable to dehydration",Dehydration
"Having a higher surface area to volume area, they also lose a higher proportion of their fluids from a high fever or burns",Dehydration
"Young children often can't tell you that they're thirsty, nor can they get a drink for themselves",Dehydration
"Older adults",Dehydration
"As you age, your body's fluid reserve becomes smaller, your ability to conserve water is reduced and your thirst sense becomes less acute",Dehydration
"These problems are compounded by chronic illnesses such as diabetes and dementia, and by the use of certain medications",Dehydration
"Older adults also may have mobility problems that limit their ability to obtain water for themselves",Dehydration
"People with chronic illnesses",Dehydration
"Having uncontrolled or untreated diabetes puts you at high risk of dehydration",Dehydration
"Kidney disease also increases your risk, as do medications that increase urination",Dehydration
"Even having a cold or sore throat makes you more susceptible to dehydration because you're less likely to feel like eating or drinking when you're sick",Dehydration
"People who work or exercise outside",Dehydration
"When it's hot and humid, your risk of dehydration and heat illness increases",Dehydration
"That's because when the air is humid, sweat can't evaporate and cool you as quickly as it normally does, and this can lead to an increased body temperature and the need for more fluids",Dehydration
"In an otherwise healthy, well-fed baby, signs of colic include: Predictable crying episodes",Colic

"The knee joint is a complex structure of bones, ligaments, tendons and other tissues that work together",ACL injury
"It's important to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis to determine the severity of the injury and get proper treatment",ACL injury
"The ACL, one of two ligaments that cross in the middle of the knee, connects your thighbone (femur) to your shinbone (tibia) and helps stabilize your knee joint",ACL injury
"Most ACL injuries happen during sports and fitness activities that can put stress on the knee: Suddenly slowing down and changing direction (cutting) Pivoting with your foot firmly planted Landing from a jump incorrectly Stopping suddenly Receiving a direct blow to the knee or collision, such as a football tackle When the ligament is damaged, there is usually a partial or complete tear across the tissue",ACL injury
"A mild injury may overextend the ligament but leave it intact",ACL injury
"Studies have suggested some reasons for these differences in risk",ACL injury
"In general, women athletes exhibit a strength imbalance in their thighs with the muscles at the front of the thigh (quadriceps) being stronger than the muscles at the back (hamstrings)",ACL injury
"The hamstrings help prevent the shinbone from moving too far forward — movement that can overextend the ACL",ACL injury
"Studies comparing jumping and landing techniques among men and women athletes have shown that women athletes are more likely to land from a jump in a way that increases stress on their knees",ACL injury
"Research suggests that training to strengthen muscles of the legs, hips and lower torso — as well as training to improve jumping and landing techniques — may reduce the higher ACL injury risk associated with women athletes",ACL injury
"Arthritis may occur even if you have surgery to reconstruct the ligament",ACL injury
"Multiple factors likely influence the risk of arthritis, such as the severity of the original injury, the presence of related injuries in the knee joint or the level of activity after treatment",ACL injury
"As the disease progresses, symptoms become worse",Pulmonary hypertension
"Each time blood passes through your heart, the lower right chamber (right ventricle) pumps blood to your lungs through a large blood vessel (pulmonary artery)",Pulmonary hypertension
"Chambers and valves of the heart Chambers and valves of the heart In your lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen",Pulmonary hypertension
"The oxygen-rich blood then flows through blood vessels in your lungs (pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins) to the left side of your heart",Pulmonary hypertension
"Ordinarily, the blood flows easily through the vessels in your lungs, so blood pressure is usually much lower in your lungs",Pulmonary hypertension
"With pulmonary hypertension, the rise in blood pressure is caused by changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries",Pulmonary hypertension
"These changes can cause the walls of the arteries to become stiff and thick, and extra tissue may form",Pulmonary hypertension
"The blood vessels may also become inflamed and tight",Pulmonary hypertension
"These changes in the pulmonary arteries can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels",Pulmonary hypertension
"This makes it harder for blood to flow, raising the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries",Pulmonary hypertension
"Pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary hypertension is classified into five groups, depending on the cause",Pulmonary hypertension
"It's most commonly caused by a large hole in your heart between the two lower heart chambers (ventricles), called a ventricular septal defect",Pulmonary hypertension
"This hole in your heart causes blood to circulate abnormally in your heart",Pulmonary hypertension
"Oxygen-carrying blood (red blood) mixes with oxygen-poor blood (blue blood)",Pulmonary hypertension
"The blood then returns to your lungs instead of going to the rest of your body, increasing the pressure in the pulmonary arteries and causing pulmonary hypertension",Pulmonary hypertension

"He or she may want to test you for the condition, especially if you have signs or symptoms of narrowed arteries",Coronary artery disease
"The damage may be caused by various factors, including: Smoking High blood pressure High cholesterol Diabetes or insulin resistance Sedentary lifestyle Once the inner wall of an artery is damaged, fatty deposits (plaque) made of cholesterol and other cellular waste products tend to accumulate at the site of injury in a process called atherosclerosis",Coronary artery disease
"If the surface of the plaque breaks or ruptures, blood cells called platelets will clump at the site to try to repair the artery",Coronary artery disease
"This clump can block the artery, leading to a heart attack",Coronary artery disease
"Simply getting older increases your risk of damaged and narrowed arteries",Coronary artery disease
"Men are generally at greater risk of coronary artery disease",Coronary artery disease
"However, the risk for women increases after menopause",Coronary artery disease

"In studies of people diagnosed with acute HCV, rates of spontaneous viral clearance have varied from 14 to 50 percent",Hepatitis C
"Acute hepatitis C also responds well to antiviral therapy",Hepatitis C
"The infection spreads when blood contaminated with the virus enters the bloodstream of an uninfected person",Hepatitis C
"Globally, HCV exists in several distinct forms, known as genotypes",Hepatitis C
"The most common HCV genotype in North America and Europe is type 1",Hepatitis C

"People with nonresponsive celiac disease may have additional conditions, such as bacteria in the small intestine (bacterial overgrowth), microscopic colitis, poor pancreas function, irritable bowel syndrome or intolerance to disaccharides (lactose and fructose)",Celiac disease
"Or, they may have refractory celiac disease",Celiac disease
"Refractory celiac disease In rare instances, the intestinal injury of celiac disease persists and leads to substantial malabsorption, even though you have followed a strict gluten-free diet",Celiac disease
"This combination is known as refractory celiac disease",Celiac disease
"If you continue to experience signs and symptoms despite following a gluten-free diet for six months to one year, your doctor may recommend further testing and look for other explanations for your symptoms",Celiac disease
"Your doctor may recommend treatment with a steroid to reduce intestinal inflammation, or a medication that suppresses your immune system",Celiac disease
"All patients with celiac disease should be followed up to monitor the response of their disease to treatment",Celiac disease
"In fact, you can have type 2 diabetes for years and not know it",Type 2 diabetes
"Look for: Increased thirst and frequent urination",Type 2 diabetes
"Excess sugar building up in your bloodstream causes fluid to be pulled from the tissues",Type 2 diabetes
"This may leave you thirsty",Type 2 diabetes
"As a result, you may drink — and urinate — more than usual",Type 2 diabetes
"Increased hunger",Type 2 diabetes
"Without enough insulin to move sugar into your cells, your muscles and organs become depleted of energy",Type 2 diabetes
"Despite eating more than usual to relieve hunger, you may lose weight",Type 2 diabetes
"Without the ability to metabolize glucose, the body uses alternative fuels stored in muscle and fat",Type 2 diabetes
"Calories are lost as excess glucose is released in the urine",Type 2 diabetes
"If your cells are deprived of sugar, you may become tired and irritable",Type 2 diabetes
"If your blood sugar is too high, fluid may be pulled from the lenses of your eyes",Type 2 diabetes
"This may affect your ability to focus",Type 2 diabetes
"Slow-healing sores or frequent infections",Type 2 diabetes
"Type 2 diabetes affects your ability to heal and resist infections",Type 2 diabetes
"Areas of darkened skin",Type 2 diabetes
"Some people with type 2 diabetes have patches of dark, velvety skin in the folds and creases of their bodies — usually in the armpits and neck",Type 2 diabetes
"This condition, called acanthosis nigricans, may be a sign of insulin resistance",Type 2 diabetes
"Exactly why this happens is unknown, although genetics and environmental factors, such as excess weight and inactivity, seem to be contributing factors",Type 2 diabetes
"How insulin works Insulin is a hormone that comes from the gland situated behind and below the stomach (pancreas)",Type 2 diabetes
"The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream",Type 2 diabetes
"The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells",Type 2 diabetes
"Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream",Type 2 diabetes
"As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas",Type 2 diabetes
"The role of glucose Glucose — a sugar — is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues",Type 2 diabetes
"Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver",Type 2 diabetes
"Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin",Type 2 diabetes
"Your liver stores and makes glucose",Type 2 diabetes
"When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range",Type 2 diabetes
"In type 2 diabetes, this process doesn't work well",Type 2 diabetes
"Instead of moving into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream",Type 2 diabetes
"As blood sugar levels increase, the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas release more insulin, but eventually these cells become impaired and can't make enough insulin to meet the body's demands",Type 2 diabetes
"In the much less common type 1 diabetes, the immune system destroys the beta cells, leaving the body with little to no insulin",Type 2 diabetes
"It's clear, however, that certain factors increase the risk, including: Weight",Type 2 diabetes
"Being overweight is a primary risk factor for type 2 diabetes",Type 2 diabetes
"The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin",Type 2 diabetes
"However, you don't have to be overweight to develop type 2 diabetes",Type 2 diabetes
"Fat distribution",Type 2 diabetes
"If your body stores fat primarily in your abdomen, your risk of type 2 diabetes is greater than if your body stores fat elsewhere, such as your hips and thighs",Type 2 diabetes
"Inactivity",Type 2 diabetes
"The less active you are, the greater your risk of type 2 diabetes",Type 2 diabetes
"Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin",Type 2 diabetes
"The risk of type 2 diabetes increases if your parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes",Type 2 diabetes
"Although it's unclear why, people of certain races — including blacks, Hispanics, American Indians and Asian-Americans — are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than whites are",Type 2 diabetes
"The risk of type 2 diabetes increases as you get older, especially after age 45",Type 2 diabetes
"That's probably because people tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as they age",Type 2 diabetes
"But type 2 diabetes is also increasing dramatically among children, adolescents and younger adults",Type 2 diabetes
"Prediabetes",Type 2 diabetes
"Prediabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes",Type 2 diabetes
"Left untreated, prediabetes often progresses to type 2 diabetes",Type 2 diabetes
"Gestational diabetes",Type 2 diabetes
"If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases",Type 2 diabetes
"If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms), you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes",Type 2 diabetes
"Polycystic ovarian syndrome",Type 2 diabetes
"For women, having polycystic ovarian syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes",Type 2 diabetes
"But diabetes affects many major organs, including your heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys",Type 2 diabetes
"Controlling your blood sugar levels can help prevent these complications",Type 2 diabetes
"Although long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually, they can eventually be disabling or even life-threatening",Type 2 diabetes
"Some of the potential complications of diabetes include:",Type 2 diabetes

"But concussions can be difficult to recognize in infants and toddlers because they can't describe how they feel",Concussion
"If your child doesn't have signs of a serious head injury, remains alert, moves normally and responds to you, the injury is probably mild and usually doesn't need further testing",Concussion
"In this case, if your child wants to nap, it's OK to let him or her sleep",Concussion
"If worrisome signs develop later, seek emergency care",Concussion
"An athlete with a suspected concussion should not return to play until he or she has been medically evaluated by a health care professional trained in evaluating and managing concussions",Concussion
"Children and adolescents should be evaluated by a health care professional trained in evaluating and managing pediatric concussions",Concussion
"Adult, child and adolescent athletes with a concussion also should not return to play on the same day as the injury",Concussion
"It's cushioned from everyday jolts and bumps by cerebrospinal fluid inside your skull",Concussion
"A violent blow to your head and neck or upper body can cause your brain to slide back and forth forcefully against the inner walls of your skull",Concussion
"Sudden acceleration or deceleration of the head, caused by events such as a car crash or being violently shaken, also can cause brain injury",Concussion
"These injuries affect brain function, usually for a brief period, resulting in signs and symptoms of concussion",Concussion
"This type of brain injury may lead to bleeding in or around your brain, causing symptoms such as prolonged drowsiness and confusion",Concussion
"These symptoms may develop immediately or later",Concussion
"Such bleeding in your brain can be fatal",Concussion
"That's why anyone who experiences a brain injury needs monitoring in the hours afterward and emergency care if symptoms worsen",Concussion
"Doctors know bone cancer begins as an error in a cell's DNA",Bone cancer
"The error tells the cell to grow and divide in an uncontrolled way",Bone cancer
"These cells go on living, rather than dying at a set time",Bone cancer
"The accumulating mutated cells form a mass (tumor) that can invade nearby structures or spread to other areas of the body",Bone cancer
"Types of bone cancer Bone cancers are broken down into separate types based on the type of cell where the cancer began",Bone cancer
