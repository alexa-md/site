"The ACL, one of two ligaments that cross in the middle of the knee, connects your thighbone (femur) to your shinbone (tibia) and helps stabilize your knee joint",ACL injury
"Most ACL injuries happen during sports and fitness activities that can put stress on the knee: Suddenly slowing down and changing direction (cutting) Pivoting with your foot firmly planted Landing from a jump incorrectly Stopping suddenly Receiving a direct blow to the knee or collision, such as a football tackle When the ligament is damaged, there is usually a partial or complete tear across the tissue",ACL injury
A mild injury may overextend the ligament but leave it intact,ACL injury
Arthritis may occur even if you have surgery to reconstruct the ligament,ACL injury
"Multiple factors likely influence the risk of arthritis, such as the severity of the original injury, the presence of related injuries in the knee joint or the level of activity after treatment",ACL injury
Allergic reactions can range from mild to severe,Allergy
"In some severe cases, allergies can trigger a life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis",Allergy
"Hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis, may cause: Sneezing Itching of the nose, eyes or roof of the mouth Runny, stuffy nose Watery, red or swollen eyes (conjunctivitis) A food allergy may cause: Tingling mouth Swelling of the lips, tongue, face or throat Hives Anaphylaxis An insect sting allergy may cause: A large area of swelling (edema) at the sting site Itching or hives all over the body Cough, chest tightness, wheezing or shortness of breath Anaphylaxis A drug allergy may cause: Hives Itchy skin Rash Facial swelling Wheezing Anaphylaxis Atopic dermatitis, an allergic skin condition also called eczema, may cause skin to: Itch Redden Flake or peel Anaphylaxis Some types of allergies, including allergies to foods and insect stings, have the potential to trigger a severe reaction known as anaphylaxis",Allergy
"A life-threatening medical emergency, anaphylaxis can cause you to go into shock",Allergy
"If you have symptoms after starting a new medication, call the doctor who prescribed it right away",Allergy
"For a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), call 911 or your local emergency number or seek emergency medical help",Allergy
"If you carry an epinephrine auto-injector (such as EpiPen, others), give yourself a shot right away",Allergy
"Even if your symptoms improve after an epinephrine injection, you should go to the emergency department to make sure symptoms don't return when the effects of the injection wear off",Allergy
"If you've had a severe allergy attack or any signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis in the past, make an appointment to see your doctor",Allergy
"Evaluation, diagnosis and long-term management of anaphylaxis are complicated, so you'll probably need to see a doctor who specializes in allergies and immunology",Allergy
The immune system then produces antibodies that remain on the alert for that particular allergen,Allergy
"When you're exposed to the allergen again, these antibodies can release a number of immune system chemicals, such as histamine, that cause allergy symptoms",Allergy
"You're at increased risk of allergies if you have family members with asthma or allergies such as hay fever, hives or eczema",Allergy
But some people's immune systems overreact to substances that don't normally cause an allergic reaction,Anaphylaxis
"Allergy symptoms aren't usually life-threatening, but a severe allergic reaction can lead to anaphylaxis",Anaphylaxis
"Even if you or your child has had only a mild anaphylactic reaction in the past, there's a risk of more severe anaphylaxis after another exposure to the allergy-causing substance",Anaphylaxis
"The most common anaphylaxis triggers in children are food allergies, such as to peanuts, and tree nuts, fish, shellfish and milk",Anaphylaxis
"Besides allergy to peanuts, nuts, fish and shellfish, anaphylaxis triggers in adults include: Certain medications, including antibiotics, aspirin and other over-the-counter pain relievers, and the intravenous (IV) contrast used in some imaging tests Stings from bees, yellow jackets, wasps, hornets and fire ants Latex Although not common, some people develop anaphylaxis from aerobic exercise, such as jogging, or even less intense physical activity, such as walking",Anaphylaxis
"Eating certain foods before exercise or exercising when the weather is hot, cold or humid also has been linked to anaphylaxis in some people",Anaphylaxis
Talk with your doctor about precautions to take when exercising,Anaphylaxis
"If you don't know what triggers your allergy attack, certain tests can help identify the allergen",Anaphylaxis
"In some cases, the cause of anaphylaxis is never identified (idiopathic anaphylaxis)",Anaphylaxis
"If you've had anaphylaxis once, your risk of having this serious reaction increases",Anaphylaxis
Future reactions might be more severe than the first reaction,Anaphylaxis
Allergies or asthma,Anaphylaxis
People who have either condition are at increased risk of having anaphylaxis,Anaphylaxis
Certain other conditions,Anaphylaxis
These include heart disease and an abnormal accumulation of a certain type of white blood cell (mastocytosis),Anaphylaxis
Lingering lung inflammation means your asthma could flare up at any time,Asthma attack
Go to all scheduled doctor's appointments,Asthma attack
"If you have regular asthma flare-ups, low peak flow readings or other signs your asthma isn't well-controlled, make an appointment to see your doctor",Asthma attack
Asthma triggers vary from person to person,Asthma attack
"Common asthma attack triggers include: Pollen, pets, mold and dust mites Upper respiratory infections Tobacco smoke Inhaling cold, dry air Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Stress For many people, asthma symptoms get worse with a respiratory infection such as a cold",Asthma attack
Some people have asthma flare-ups caused by something in their work environment,Asthma attack
"Sometimes, asthma attacks occur with no apparent cause",Asthma attack
"See your doctor if improved hygiene doesn't eliminate the infestation, or if you develop a skin infection from scratching the bites",Body lice infestation
"While head lice live in your hair and feed on your scalp, body lice typically live in your clothes and bedding",Body lice infestation
They travel to your skin several times a day to feed on blood,Body lice infestation
The seams of your clothing are the most common places for body lice to lay their eggs (nits),Body lice infestation
"You can become infested with body lice if you come into close contact with a person who has body lice, or with clothing or bedding that is infested with body lice",Body lice infestation
"They include: War refugees Homeless people Victims of natural disasters Dogs, cats and other pets do not spread body lice",Body lice infestation
"However, a body lice infestation sometimes leads to complications such as:",Body lice infestation
Doctors know that breast cancer occurs when some breast cells begin growing abnormally,Breast cancer
"These cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells do and continue to accumulate, forming a lump or mass",Breast cancer
The cells may spread (metastasize) through your breast to your lymph nodes or to other parts of your body,Breast cancer
Breast cancer most often begins with cells in the milk-producing ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma),Breast cancer
Breast cancer may also begin in the glandular tissue called lobules (invasive lobular carcinoma) or in other cells or tissue within the breast,Breast cancer
"Researchers have identified hormonal, lifestyle and environmental factors that may increase your risk of breast cancer",Breast cancer
"But it's not clear why some people who have no risk factors develop cancer, yet other people with risk factors never do",Breast cancer
It's likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex interaction of your genetic makeup and your environment,Breast cancer
Inherited breast cancer Doctors estimate that about 5 to 10 percent of breast cancers are linked to gene mutations passed through generations of a family,Breast cancer
A number of inherited mutated genes that can increase the likelihood of breast cancer have been identified,Breast cancer
"The most common are breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer gene 2 (BRCA2), both of which significantly increase the risk of both breast and ovarian cancer",Breast cancer
"If you have a strong family history of breast cancer or other cancers, your doctor may recommend a blood test to help identify specific mutations in BRCA or other genes that are being passed through your family",Breast cancer
"Consider asking your doctor for a referral to a genetic counselor, who can review your family health history",Breast cancer
"A genetic counselor can also discuss the benefits, risks and limitations of genetic testing with you and guide you on appropriate genetic testing",Breast cancer
But having one or even several breast cancer risk factors doesn't necessarily mean you'll develop breast cancer,Breast cancer
Many women who develop breast cancer have no known risk factors other than simply being women,Breast cancer
Factors that are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer include:,Breast cancer
"Chronic bronchitis is defined as a productive cough that lasts at least three months, with recurring bouts occurring for at least two consecutive years",Bronchitis
"If you have chronic bronchitis, you're likely to have periods when your signs and symptoms worsen",Bronchitis
"At those times, you may have acute bronchitis on top of your chronic bronchitis",Bronchitis
"The first symptoms often include numbness or tingling in your thumb, index and middle fingers that comes and goes",Carpal tunnel syndrome
Carpal tunnel syndrome may also cause discomfort in your wrist and the palm of your hand,Carpal tunnel syndrome
Common carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms include: Tingling or numbness,Carpal tunnel syndrome
You may experience tingling and numbness in your fingers or hand,Carpal tunnel syndrome
"Usually the thumb and index, middle or ring fingers are affected, but not your little finger",Carpal tunnel syndrome
Sometimes there is a sensation like an electric shock in these fingers,Carpal tunnel syndrome
The sensation may travel from your wrist up your arm,Carpal tunnel syndrome
"These symptoms often occur while holding a steering wheel, phone or newspaper",Carpal tunnel syndrome
The sensation may wake you from sleep,Carpal tunnel syndrome
Many people shake out their hands to try to relieve their symptoms,Carpal tunnel syndrome
The numb feeling may become constant over time,Carpal tunnel syndrome
Weakness,Carpal tunnel syndrome
You may experience weakness in your hand and a tendency to drop objects,Carpal tunnel syndrome
"This may be due to the numbness in your hand or weakness of the thumb's pinching muscles, which are also controlled by the median nerve",Carpal tunnel syndrome
Permanent nerve and muscle damage can occur without treatment,Carpal tunnel syndrome
The median nerve runs from your forearm through a passageway in your wrist (carpal tunnel) to your hand,Carpal tunnel syndrome
"It provides sensation to the palm side of your thumb and fingers, except the little finger",Carpal tunnel syndrome
It also provides nerve signals to move the muscles around the base of your thumb (motor function),Carpal tunnel syndrome
Anything that squeezes or irritates the median nerve in the carpal tunnel space may lead to carpal tunnel syndrome,Carpal tunnel syndrome
"A wrist fracture can narrow the carpal tunnel and irritate the nerve, as can the swelling and inflammation resulting from rheumatoid arthritis",Carpal tunnel syndrome
There is no single cause in many cases,Carpal tunnel syndrome
It may be that a combination of risk factors contributes to the development of the condition,Carpal tunnel syndrome
"Although they may not directly cause carpal tunnel syndrome, they may increase your chances of developing or aggravating median nerve damage",Carpal tunnel syndrome
These include:,Carpal tunnel syndrome
Cancer cells invade nearby tissues and can break off from a tumor to spread (metastasize) elsewhere in the body,Cervical cancer
"It isn't clear what causes cervical cancer, but it's certain that HPV plays a role",Cervical cancer
"HPV is very common, and most women with the virus never develop cervical cancer",Cervical cancer
This means other factors â€” such as your environment or your lifestyle choices â€” also determine whether you'll develop cervical cancer,Cervical cancer
Types of cervical cancer The type of cervical cancer that you have helps determine your prognosis and treatment,Cervical cancer
The main types of cervical cancer are: Squamous cell carcinoma,Cervical cancer
"This type of cervical cancer begins in the thin, flat cells (squamous cells) lining the outer part of the cervix, which projects into the vagina",Cervical cancer
Most cervical cancers are squamous cell carcinomas,Cervical cancer
Adenocarcinoma,Cervical cancer
This type of cervical cancer begins in the column-shaped glandular cells that line the cervical canal,Cervical cancer
"Sometimes, both types of cells are involved in cervical cancer",Cervical cancer
"Very rarely, cancer occurs in other cells in the cervix",Cervical cancer
The rash is the telltale indication of chickenpox,Chickenpox
"Other signs and symptoms, which may appear one to two days before the rash, include: Fever Loss of appetite Headache Tiredness and a general feeling of being unwell (malaise) Once the chickenpox rash appears, it goes through three phases: Raised pink or red bumps (papules), which break out over several days Small fluid-filled blisters (vesicles), forming from the raised bumps over about one day before breaking and leaking Crusts and scabs, which cover the broken blisters and take several more days to heal New bumps continue to appear for several days",Chickenpox
"As a result, you may have all three stages of the rash â€” bumps, blisters and scabbed lesions â€” at the same time on the second day of the rash",Chickenpox
"Once infected, you can spread the virus for up to 48 hours before the rash appears, and you remain contagious until all spots crust over",Chickenpox
The disease is generally mild in healthy children,Chickenpox
"In severe cases, the rash can spread to cover the entire body, and lesions may form in the throat, eyes and mucous membranes of the urethra, anus and vagina",Chickenpox
New spots continue to appear for several days,Chickenpox
He or she usually can diagnose chickenpox by examining the rash and by noting the presence of accompanying symptoms,Chickenpox
"Your doctor can also prescribe medications to lessen the severity of chickenpox and treat complications, if necessary",Chickenpox
"Be sure to call ahead for an appointment and mention you think you or your child has chickenpox, to avoid waiting and possibly infecting others in a waiting room",Chickenpox
"Also, be sure to let your doctor know if any of these complications occur: The rash spreads to one or both eyes",Chickenpox
"The rash gets very red, warm or tender, indicating a possible secondary bacterial skin infection",Chickenpox
"The rash is accompanied by dizziness, disorientation, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, tremors, loss of muscle coordination, worsening cough, vomiting, stiff neck or a fever higher than 102 F (38",Chickenpox
Anyone in the household is immune deficient or younger than 6 months old,Chickenpox
The virus is transmitted by direct contact with the rash or by droplets dispersed into the air by coughing or sneezing,Chickenpox
Your risk of catching chickenpox is higher if you: Haven't had chickenpox Haven't been vaccinated for chickenpox Work in or attend a school or child care facility Live with children Most people who have had chickenpox or have been vaccinated against chickenpox are immune to chickenpox,Chickenpox
"If you've been vaccinated and still get chickenpox, symptoms are often milder, with fewer blisters and mild or no fever",Chickenpox
"A few people can get chickenpox more than once, but this is rare",Chickenpox
"But it can be serious and can lead to complications or death, especially in high-risk people",Chickenpox
"Chickenpox early in pregnancy can result in a variety of problems in a newborn, including low birth weight and birth defects, such as limb abnormalities",Chickenpox
A greater threat to a baby occurs when the mother develops chickenpox in the week before birth or within a couple of days after giving birth,Chickenpox
"Then it can cause a serious, life-threatening infection in a newborn",Chickenpox
"If you're pregnant and not immune to chickenpox, talk to your doctor about the risks to you and your unborn child",Chickenpox
"Chickenpox and shingles If you've had chickenpox, you're at risk of another disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus called shingles",Chickenpox
"After a chickenpox infection, some of the varicella-zoster virus may remain in your nerve cells",Chickenpox
"Many years later, the virus can reactivate and resurface as shingles â€” a painful band of short-lived blisters",Chickenpox
The virus is more likely to reappear in older adults and people with weakened immune systems,Chickenpox
Shingles can lead to its own complication â€” a condition in which the pain of shingles persists long after the blisters disappear,Chickenpox
"This complication, called postherpetic neuralgia, can be severe",Chickenpox
A shingles vaccine (Zostavax) is available and is recommended for adults age 60 and older who have had chickenpox,Chickenpox
"You might describe your chronic pelvic pain in one or more of the following ways: Severe and steady pain Pain that comes and goes (intermittent) Dull aching Sharp pains or cramping Pressure or heaviness deep within your pelvis In addition, you may experience: Pain during intercourse Pain while having a bowel movement or urinating Pain when you sit for long periods of time Your discomfort may intensify after standing for long periods and may be relieved when you lie down",Chronic pelvic pain
"The pain may be mild and annoying, or it may be so severe that you miss work, can't sleep and can't exercise",Chronic pelvic pain
"In general, make an appointment with your doctor if your pelvic pain disrupts your daily life or if your symptoms seem to be getting worse",Chronic pelvic pain
"Sometimes, a single disorder may be identified as the cause",Chronic pelvic pain
"In other cases, however, pain may be the result of several medical conditions",Chronic pelvic pain
"For example, a woman might have endometriosis and interstitial cystitis, both of which contribute to chronic pelvic pain",Chronic pelvic pain
Some causes of chronic pelvic pain include:,Chronic pelvic pain
"Many people feel an itching, burning or tingling sensation around their lips for a day or so before a small, hard, painful spot appears and blisters erupt",Cold sore
Blisters,Cold sore
Small fluid-filled blisters typically break out along the border where the outside edge of the lips meets the skin of the face,Cold sore
Cold sores can also occur around the nose or on the cheeks,Cold sore
Oozing and crusting,Cold sore
"The small blisters may merge and then burst, leaving shallow open sores that will ooze fluid and then crust over",Cold sore
"Signs and symptoms vary, depending on whether this is your first outbreak or a recurrence",Cold sore
"They can last several days, and the blisters can take two to four weeks to heal completely",Cold sore
Recurrences typically appear at the same spot each time and tend to be less severe than the first outbreak,Cold sore
"During first-time outbreaks, some people also experience: Fever Painful eroded gums Sore throat Headache Muscle aches Swollen lymph nodes Children under 5 years old may have cold sores inside their mouths and the lesions are commonly mistaken for canker sores",Cold sore
Canker sores involve only the mucous membrane and aren't caused by the herpes simplex virus,Cold sore
"When symptoms appear, they'll likely vary, depending on the cancer's size and location in your large intestine",Colon cancer
Talk to your doctor about when you should begin screening for colon cancer,Colon cancer
Guidelines generally recommend that colon cancer screenings begin at age 50,Colon cancer
"Your doctor may recommend more frequent or earlier screening if you have other risk factors, such as a family history of the disease",Colon cancer
Doctors know that colon cancer occurs when healthy cells in the colon develop errors in their DNA,Colon cancer
Healthy cells grow and divide in an orderly way to keep your body functioning normally,Colon cancer
"But when a cell's DNA is damaged and becomes cancerous, cells continue to divide â€” even when new cells aren't needed",Colon cancer
"As the cells accumulate, they form a tumor",Colon cancer
"With time, the cancer cells can grow to invade and destroy normal tissue nearby",Colon cancer
And cancerous cells can travel to other parts of the body,Colon cancer
"Inherited gene mutations that increase the risk of colon cancer Inherited gene mutations that increase the risk of colon cancer can be passed through families, but these inherited genes are linked to only a small percentage of colon cancers",Colon cancer
"Inherited gene mutations don't make cancer inevitable, but they can increase an individual's risk of cancer significantly",Colon cancer
The most common forms of inherited colon cancer syndromes are: Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC),Colon cancer
"HNPCC, also called Lynch syndrome, increases the risk of colon cancer and other cancers",Colon cancer
People with HNPCC tend to develop colon cancer before age 50,Colon cancer
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP),Colon cancer
FAP is a rare disorder that causes you to develop thousands of polyps in the lining of your colon and rectum,Colon cancer
People with untreated FAP have a greatly increased risk of developing colon cancer before age 40,Colon cancer
"FAP, HNPCC and other, rarer inherited colon cancer syndromes can be detected through genetic testing",Colon cancer
"If you're concerned about your family's history of colon cancer, talk to your doctor about whether your family history suggests you have a risk of these conditions",Colon cancer
Association between diet and increased colon cancer risk Studies of large groups of people have shown an association between a typical Western diet and an increased risk of colon cancer,Colon cancer
A typical Western diet is high in fat and low in fiber,Colon cancer
"When people move from areas where the typical diet is low in fat and high in fiber to areas where the typical Western diet is most common, the risk of colon cancer in these people increases significantly",Colon cancer
"It's not clear why this occurs, but researchers are studying whether a high-fat, low-fiber diet affects the microbes that live in the colon or causes underlying inflammation that may contribute to cancer risk",Colon cancer
This is an area of active investigation and research is ongoing,Colon cancer
"Signs and symptoms, which can vary from person to person, might include: Runny or stuffy nose Sore throat Cough Congestion Slight body aches or a mild headache Sneezing Low-grade fever Generally feeling unwell (malaise) The discharge from your nose may become thicker and yellow or green in color as a common cold runs its course",Common cold
This isn't an indication of a bacterial infection,Common cold
But seek medical attention right away if your child has any of the following: Fever of 100,Common cold
"A cold virus enters your body through your mouth, eyes or nose",Common cold
"The virus can spread through droplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks",Common cold
"It also spreads by hand-to-hand contact with someone who has a cold or by sharing contaminated objects, such as utensils, towels, toys or telephones",Common cold
"If you touch your eyes, nose or mouth after such contact or exposure, you're likely to catch a cold",Common cold
"Children younger than six are at greatest risk of colds, especially if they spend time in child-care settings",Common cold
Weakened immune system,Common cold
Having a chronic illness or otherwise weakened immune system increases your risk,Common cold
Time of year ,Common cold
"Both children and adults are more susceptible to colds in fall and winter, but you can get a cold any time",Common cold
"Common symptoms after a concussive traumatic brain injury are headache, loss of memory (amnesia) and confusion",Concussion
The amnesia usually involves forgetting the event that caused the concussion,Concussion
Signs and symptoms of a concussion may include: Headache or a feeling of pressure in the head Temporary loss of consciousness Confusion or feeling as if in a fog Amnesia surrounding the traumatic event Dizziness or seeing stars Ringing in the ears Nausea Vomiting Slurred speech Delayed response to questions Appearing dazed Fatigue You may have some symptoms of concussions immediately,Concussion
But concussions can be difficult to recognize in infants and toddlers because they can't describe how they feel,Concussion
"If your child doesn't have signs of a serious head injury, remains alert, moves normally and responds to you, the injury is probably mild and usually doesn't need further testing",Concussion
"In this case, if your child wants to nap, it's OK to let him or her sleep",Concussion
"If worrisome signs develop later, seek emergency care",Concussion
An athlete with a suspected concussion should not return to play until he or she has been medically evaluated by a health care professional trained in evaluating and managing concussions,Concussion
Children and adolescents should be evaluated by a health care professional trained in evaluating and managing pediatric concussions,Concussion
"Adult, child and adolescent athletes with a concussion also should not return to play on the same day as the injury",Concussion
It's cushioned from everyday jolts and bumps by cerebrospinal fluid inside your skull,Concussion
A violent blow to your head and neck or upper body can cause your brain to slide back and forth forcefully against the inner walls of your skull,Concussion
"Sudden acceleration or deceleration of the head, caused by events such as a car crash or being violently shaken, also can cause brain injury",Concussion
"These injuries affect brain function, usually for a brief period, resulting in signs and symptoms of concussion",Concussion
"This type of brain injury may lead to bleeding in or around your brain, causing symptoms such as prolonged drowsiness and confusion",Concussion
These symptoms may develop immediately or later,Concussion
Such bleeding in your brain can be fatal,Concussion
That's why anyone who experiences a brain injury needs monitoring in the hours afterward and emergency care if symptoms worsen,Concussion
"At first, the decreased blood flow may not cause any coronary artery disease symptoms",Coronary artery disease
"As plaque continues to build up in your coronary arteries, however, you may develop coronary artery disease signs and symptoms, including: Chest pain (angina)",Coronary artery disease
"You may feel pressure or tightness in your chest, as if someone were standing on your chest",Coronary artery disease
"This pain, referred to as angina, usually occurs on the middle or left side of the chest",Coronary artery disease
Angina is generally triggered by physical or emotional stress,Coronary artery disease
The pain usually goes away within minutes after stopping the stressful activity,Coronary artery disease
"In some people, especially women, this pain may be fleeting or sharp and felt in the neck, arm or back",Coronary artery disease
Shortness of breath,Coronary artery disease
"If your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs, you may develop shortness of breath or extreme fatigue with exertion",Coronary artery disease
A completely blocked coronary artery may cause a heart attack,Coronary artery disease
"The classic signs and symptoms of a heart attack include crushing pressure in your chest and pain in your shoulder or arm, sometimes with shortness of breath and sweating",Coronary artery disease
"Women are somewhat more likely than men are to experience less typical signs and symptoms of a heart attack, such as neck or jaw pain",Coronary artery disease
Sometimes a heart attack occurs without any apparent signs or symptoms,Coronary artery disease
Drive yourself only as a last resort,Coronary artery disease
"If you have risk factors for coronary artery disease â€” such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, tobacco use, diabetes, a strong family history of heart disease or obesity â€” talk to your doctor",Coronary artery disease
"He or she may want to test you for the condition, especially if you have signs or symptoms of narrowed arteries",Coronary artery disease
"The damage may be caused by various factors, including: Smoking High blood pressure High cholesterol Diabetes or insulin resistance Sedentary lifestyle Once the inner wall of an artery is damaged, fatty deposits (plaque) made of cholesterol and other cellular waste products tend to accumulate at the site of injury in a process called atherosclerosis",Coronary artery disease
"If the surface of the plaque breaks or ruptures, blood cells called platelets will clump at the site to try to repair the artery",Coronary artery disease
"This clump can block the artery, leading to a heart attack",Coronary artery disease
Simply getting older increases your risk of damaged and narrowed arteries,Coronary artery disease
Men are generally at greater risk of coronary artery disease,Coronary artery disease
"However, the risk for women increases after menopause",Coronary artery disease
"A family history of heart disease is associated with a higher risk of coronary artery disease, especially if a close relative developed heart disease at an early age",Coronary artery disease
Your risk is highest if your father or a brother was diagnosed with heart disease before age 55 or if your mother or a sister developed it before age 65,Coronary artery disease
People who smoke have a significantly increased risk of heart disease,Coronary artery disease
Exposing others to your secondhand smoke also increases their risk of coronary artery disease,Coronary artery disease
"Uncontrolled high blood pressure can result in hardening and thickening of your arteries, narrowing the channel through which blood can flow",Coronary artery disease
High blood cholesterol levels,Coronary artery disease
High levels of cholesterol in your blood can increase the risk of formation of plaques and atherosclerosis,Coronary artery disease
"High cholesterol can be caused by a high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), known as the bad cholesterol",Coronary artery disease
"A low level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), known as the good cholesterol, can be a sign of atherosclerosis",Coronary artery disease
Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease,Coronary artery disease
"Type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease share similar risk factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure",Coronary artery disease
Overweight or obesity,Coronary artery disease
Excess weight typically worsens other risk factors,Coronary artery disease
Physical inactivity,Coronary artery disease
"Lack of exercise also is associated with coronary artery disease and some of its risk factors, as well",Coronary artery disease
High stress,Coronary artery disease
Unrelieved stress in your life may damage your arteries as well as worsen other risk factors for coronary artery disease,Coronary artery disease
"When grouped together, certain risk factors put you at an even greater risk of coronary artery disease",Coronary artery disease
"For example, metabolic syndrome â€” a cluster of conditions that includes elevated blood pressure, high triglycerides, elevated insulin levels and excess body fat around the waist â€” increases the risk of coronary artery disease",Coronary artery disease
Sometimes coronary artery disease develops without any classic risk factors,Coronary artery disease
"Researchers are studying other possible factors, including: Sleep apnea",Coronary artery disease
This disorder causes you to repeatedly stop and start breathing while you're sleeping,Coronary artery disease
"Sudden drops in blood oxygen levels that occur during sleep apnea increase blood pressure and strain the cardiovascular system, possibly leading to coronary artery disease",Coronary artery disease
High sensitivity C-reactive protein,Coronary artery disease
High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is a normal protein that appears in higher amounts when there's inflammation somewhere in your body,Coronary artery disease
High hs-CRP levels may be a risk factor for heart disease,Coronary artery disease
"It's thought that as coronary arteries narrow, you'll have more hs-CRP in your blood",Coronary artery disease
High triglycerides,Coronary artery disease
This is a type of fat (lipid) in your blood,Coronary artery disease
"High levels may raise the risk of coronary artery disease, especially for women",Coronary artery disease
Homocysteine,Coronary artery disease
Homocysteine is an amino acid your body uses to make protein and to build and maintain tissue,Coronary artery disease
But high levels of homocysteine may increase your risk of coronary artery disease,Coronary artery disease
"Many people, particularly older adults, don't feel thirsty until they're already dehydrated",Dehydration
That's why it's important to increase water intake during hot weather or when you're ill,Dehydration
The signs and symptoms of dehydration also may differ by age,Dehydration
"Other dehydration causes include: Diarrhea, vomiting",Dehydration
"Severe, acute diarrhea â€” that is, diarrhea that comes on suddenly and violently â€” can cause a tremendous loss of water and electrolytes in a short amount of time",Dehydration
"If you have vomiting along with diarrhea, you lose even more fluids and minerals",Dehydration
The problem worsens if you have a fever in addition to diarrhea and vomiting,Dehydration
Excessive sweating,Dehydration
You lose water when you sweat,Dehydration
"If you do vigorous activity and don't replace fluids as you go along, you can become dehydrated",Dehydration
"Hot, humid weather increases the amount you sweat and the amount of fluid you lose",Dehydration
Increased urination,Dehydration
This may be due to undiagnosed or uncontrolled diabetes,Dehydration
"Certain medications, such as diuretics and some blood pressure medications, also can lead to dehydration, generally because they cause you to urinate more",Dehydration
"The most likely group to experience severe diarrhea and vomiting, infants and children are especially vulnerable to dehydration",Dehydration
"Having a higher surface area to volume area, they also lose a higher proportion of their fluids from a high fever or burns",Dehydration
"Young children often can't tell you that they're thirsty, nor can they get a drink for themselves",Dehydration
The most common types of dermatitis include: Atopic dermatitis (eczema),Dermatitis/eczema
"Usually beginning in infancy, this red, itchy rash most commonly occurs where the skin flexes â€” inside the elbows, behind the knees and the front of the neck",Dermatitis/eczema
"When scratched, the rash can leak fluid and crust over",Dermatitis/eczema
People with atopic dermatitis may experience improvement and then flare-ups,Dermatitis/eczema
Contact dermatitis,Dermatitis/eczema
"This rash occurs on areas of the body that have come into contact with substances that either irritate the skin or cause an allergic reaction, such as poison ivy, soap and essential oils",Dermatitis/eczema
"The red rash may burn, sting or itch",Dermatitis/eczema
Blisters may develop,Dermatitis/eczema
Seborrheic dermatitis,Dermatitis/eczema
"This condition causes scaly patches, red skin and stubborn dandruff",Dermatitis/eczema
"It usually affects oily areas of the body, such as the face, upper chest and back",Dermatitis/eczema
It can be a long-term condition with periods of remission and flare-ups,Dermatitis/eczema
"In infants, this disorder is known as cradle cap",Dermatitis/eczema
"This form of dermatitis is likely related to a mix of factors, including dry skin, a gene variation, an immune system dysfunction, bacteria on the skin and environmental conditions",Dermatitis/eczema
"This condition results from direct contact with one of many irritants or allergens â€” such as poison ivy, jewelry containing nickel, cleaning products, perfumes, cosmetics, and even the preservatives in many creams and lotions",Dermatitis/eczema
This condition may be caused by a yeast (fungus) that is in the oil secretion on the skin,Dermatitis/eczema
People with seborrheic dermatitis may notice their condition tends to come and go depending on the season,Dermatitis/eczema
Examples include: Age,Dermatitis/eczema
"Dermatitis can occur at any age, but atopic dermatitis (eczema) usually begins in infancy",Dermatitis/eczema

Not eating for a couple of hours before exercising and avoiding certain foods may help prevent this problem,Food allergy
"Pollen-food allergy syndrome In many people who have hay fever, fresh fruits and vegetables and certain nuts and spices can trigger an allergic reaction that causes the mouth to tingle or itch",Food allergy
"In some people, pollen-food allergy syndrome â€” sometimes called oral allergy syndrome â€” can cause swelling of the throat or even anaphylaxis",Food allergy
This is an example of cross-reactivity,Food allergy
Proteins in fruits and vegetables cause the reaction because they're similar to those allergy-causing proteins found in certain pollens,Food allergy
"For example, if you're allergic to ragweed, you may also react to melons; if you're allergic to birch pollen, you may also react to apples",Food allergy
Cooking fruits and vegetables can help you avoid this reaction,Food allergy

Your bile contains too much bilirubin,Gallstones
Bilirubin is a chemical that's produced when your body breaks down red blood cells,Gallstones
"Certain conditions cause your liver to make too much bilirubin, including liver cirrhosis, biliary tract infections and certain blood disorders",Gallstones
The excess bilirubin contributes to gallstone formation,Gallstones
Your gallbladder doesn't empty correctly,Gallstones
"If your gallbladder doesn't empty completely or often enough, bile may become very concentrated, contributing to the formation of gallstones",Gallstones
Types of gallstones Types of gallstones that can form in the gallbladder include: Cholesterol gallstones,Gallstones
"The most common type of gallstone, called a cholesterol gallstone, often appears yellow in color",Gallstones
"These gallstones are composed mainly of undissolved cholesterol, but may contain other components",Gallstones

These lie inside the rectum,Hemorrhoids
"You usually can't see or feel these hemorrhoids, and they rarely cause discomfort",Hemorrhoids
But straining or irritation when passing stool can damage a hemorrhoid's surface and cause it to bleed,Hemorrhoids
"Occasionally, straining can push an internal hemorrhoid through the anal opening",Hemorrhoids
This is known as a protruding or prolapsed hemorrhoid and can cause pain and irritation,Hemorrhoids
External hemorrhoids,Hemorrhoids
These are under the skin around your anus,Hemorrhoids
"When irritated, external hemorrhoids can itch or bleed",Hemorrhoids
Thrombosed hemorrhoids,Hemorrhoids
"Sometimes blood may pool in an external hemorrhoid and form a clot (thrombus) that can result in severe pain, swelling, inflammation and a hard lump near your anus",Hemorrhoids
Your doctor can do a physical examination and perform other tests to confirm hemorrhoids and rule out more-serious conditions or diseases,Hemorrhoids
"Also talk to your doctor if you know you have hemorrhoids and they cause pain, bleed frequently or excessively, or don't improve with home remedies",Hemorrhoids
"Don't assume rectal bleeding is due to hemorrhoids, especially if you are over 40 years old",Hemorrhoids
"Rectal bleeding can occur with other diseases, including colorectal cancer and anal cancer",Hemorrhoids
"If you have bleeding along with a marked change in bowel habits or if your stools change in color or consistency, consult your doctor",Hemorrhoids
These types of stools can signal more extensive bleeding elsewhere in your digestive tract,Hemorrhoids
"Seek emergency care if you experience large amounts of rectal bleeding, lightheadedness, dizziness or faintness",Hemorrhoids
Swollen veins (hemorrhoids) can develop from increased pressure in the lower rectum due to: Straining during bowel movements Sitting for long periods of time on the toilet Chronic diarrhea or constipation Obesity Pregnancy Anal intercourse Low-fiber diet Hemorrhoids are more likely with aging because the tissues that support the veins in your rectum and anus can weaken and stretch,Hemorrhoids
"Chronic hepatitis C is usually a silent infection for many years, until the virus damages the liver enough to cause the signs and symptoms of liver disease",Hepatitis C
"Among these signs and symptoms are: Bleeding easily Bruising easily Fatigue Poor appetite Yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes (jaundice) Dark-colored urine Itchy skin Fluid buildup in your abdomen (ascites) Swelling in your legs Weight loss Confusion, drowsiness and slurred speech (hepatic encephalopathy) Spider-like blood vessels on your skin (spider angiomas) Every chronic hepatitis C infection starts with an acute phase",Hepatitis C
Acute hepatitis C usually goes undiagnosed because it rarely causes symptoms,Hepatitis C
"When signs and symptoms are present, they may include jaundice, along with fatigue, nausea, fever and muscle aches",Hepatitis C
Acute symptoms appear one to three months after exposure to the virus and last two weeks to three months,Hepatitis C
Acute hepatitis C infection doesn't always become chronic,Hepatitis C
"Some people clear HCV from their bodies after the acute phase, an outcome known as spontaneous viral clearance",Hepatitis C
"In studies of people diagnosed with acute HCV, rates of spontaneous viral clearance have varied from 14 to 50 percent",Hepatitis C
Acute hepatitis C also responds well to antiviral therapy,Hepatitis C
The infection spreads when blood contaminated with the virus enters the bloodstream of an uninfected person,Hepatitis C
"Globally, HCV exists in several distinct forms, known as genotypes",Hepatitis C
The most common HCV genotype in North America and Europe is type 1,Hepatitis C
"Type 2 also occurs in the United States and Europe, but is less common than type 1",Hepatitis C
"Both type 1 and type 2 have also spread through much of the world, although other genotypes cause a majority of infections in the Middle East, Asia and Africa",Hepatitis C

"A few people with high blood pressure may have headaches, shortness of breath or nosebleeds, but these signs and symptoms aren't specific and usually don't occur until high blood pressure has reached a severe or life-threatening stage",High blood pressure
Ask your doctor for a blood pressure reading at least every two years starting at age 18,High blood pressure
"If you're age 40 or older, or you're age 18-39 with a high risk of high blood pressure, ask your doctor for a blood pressure reading every year",High blood pressure
Blood pressure generally should be checked in both arms to determine if there is a difference,High blood pressure
It's important to use an appropriate-sized arm cuff,High blood pressure
Your doctor will likely recommend more frequent readings if you've already been diagnosed with high blood pressure or have other risk factors for cardiovascular disease,High blood pressure
Children age 3 and older will usually have blood pressure measured as a part of their yearly checkups,High blood pressure
"If you don't regularly see your doctor, you may be able to get a free blood pressure screening at a health resource fair or other locations in your community",High blood pressure
You can also find machines in some stores that will measure your blood pressure for free,High blood pressure
"Public blood pressure machines, such as those found in pharmacies, may provide helpful information about your blood pressure, but they may have some limitations",High blood pressure
"The accuracy of these machines depends on several factors, such as a correct cuff size and proper use of the machines",High blood pressure

Primary infection (Acute HIV) The majority of people infected by HIV develop a flu-like illness within a month or two after the virus enters the body,HIV/AIDS
"This illness, known as primary or acute HIV infection, may last for a few weeks",HIV/AIDS
"Possible signs and symptoms include: Fever Headache Muscle aches and joint pain Rash Sore throat Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck Although the symptoms of primary HIV infection may be mild enough to go unnoticed, the amount of virus in the bloodstream (viral load) is particularly high at this time",HIV/AIDS
"As a result, HIV infection spreads more efficiently during primary infection than during the next stage of infection",HIV/AIDS
"Clinical latent infection (Chronic HIV) In some people, persistent swelling of lymph nodes occurs during clinical latent HIV",HIV/AIDS
"Otherwise, there are no specific signs and symptoms",HIV/AIDS
"HIV remains in the body, however, and in infected white blood cells",HIV/AIDS
Clinical latent infection generally lasts around 10 years if you're not receiving antiretroviral therapy,HIV/AIDS
This phase can last for decades in people taking antiretroviral medications,HIV/AIDS
But some people progress to more severe disease much sooner,HIV/AIDS
"Early symptomatic HIV infection As the virus continues to multiply and destroy immune cells, you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as: Fever Fatigue Swollen lymph nodes â€” often one of the first signs of HIV infection Diarrhea Weight loss Oral yeast infection (thrush) Shingles (herpes zoster) Progression to AIDS If you receive no treatment for your HIV infection, the disease typically progresses to AIDS in about 10 years",HIV/AIDS
"By the time AIDS develops, your immune system has been severely damaged, making you susceptible to opportunistic infections â€” diseases that wouldn't usually trouble a person with a healthy immune system",HIV/AIDS
"When warts do appear, they vary in appearance depending on which variety of HPV is involved: Genital warts",HPV infection

"They can appear anywhere, but children usually get them on the face and men tend to get them in the beard area",HPV infection
Women tend to get them on the legs,HPV infection
Cervical cancer It's important to remember that being vaccinated against HPV infection can protect you from cervical cancer,HPV infection
"For those who aren't vaccinated, most cases of cervical cancer are caused by HPV strains that usually don't cause warts, so women often don't realize they've been infected",HPV infection
Early stages of cervical cancer typically cause no signs or symptoms,HPV infection
"Over time, repeated infection of certain HPV strains can lead to precancerous lesions",HPV infection
"If not treated, these lesions can become cancerous",HPV infection
"That's why it's important for women to have regular Pap tests, which can detect precancerous changes in the cervix that might lead to cancer",HPV infection
Current guidelines recommend that women ages 21 to 29 have a Pap test every three years,HPV infection
"Women ages 30 to 65 are advised to continue having a Pap test every three years, or every five years if they also get the HPV DNA test at the same time",HPV infection
"Women over 65 can stop testing if they've had three normal Pap tests in a row, or two HPV DNA and Pap tests with no abnormal results",HPV infection
The virus is transferred primarily by skin-to-skin contact,HPV infection
"Genital HPV infections are contracted through sexual intercourse, anal sex and other skin-to-skin contact in the genital region",HPV infection
Some HPV infections that result in oral or upper respiratory lesions are contracted through oral sex,HPV infection
"If you're pregnant and have an HPV infection with genital warts, the warts might enlarge and multiply during pregnancy",HPV infection
Treatment might have to wait until after delivery,HPV infection
"Large genital warts can block the birth canal, complicating vaginal delivery",HPV infection
"The infection might be linked to a rare, noncancerous growth in the baby's voice box (larynx)",HPV infection
Warts are contagious,HPV infection
They spread by contact with a wart or with something that touched the wart,HPV infection
"The more sexual partners you have, the more likely you are to contract a genital HPV infection",HPV infection
Having sex with a partner who has had multiple sex partners also increases your risk,HPV infection
Common warts occur mostly in children,HPV infection
Genital warts occur most often in adolescents and young adults,HPV infection
Weakened immune systems,HPV infection
People who have weakened immune systems are at greater risk of HPV infections,HPV infection
Immune systems can be weakened by HIV/AIDS or by immune system-suppressing drugs used after organ transplants,HPV infection
Damaged skin,HPV infection
Areas of skin that have been punctured or opened are more prone to develop common warts,HPV infection
Personal contact,HPV infection
Touching someone's warts or not wearing protection before contacting surfaces that have been exposed to HPV â€” such as public showers or swimming pools â€” might increase your risk of HPV infection,HPV infection

Common signs and symptoms of the flu include: Fever over 100,Influenza
"If you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your doctor right away",Influenza
Taking antiviral drugs within the first 48 hours after you first notice symptoms may reduce the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems,Influenza
"You can inhale the droplets directly, or you can pick up the germs from an object â€” such as a telephone or computer keyboard â€” and then transfer them to your eyes, nose or mouth",Influenza
"People with the virus are likely contagious from the day or so before symptoms first appear until about five days after symptoms begin, though sometimes people are contagious for as long as 10 days after symptoms appear",Influenza
Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time,Influenza
"Influenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing regularly",Influenza
"If you've had influenza in the past, your body has already made antibodies to fight that particular strain of the virus",Influenza
"If future influenza viruses are similar to those you've encountered before, either by having the disease or by vaccination, those antibodies may prevent infection or lessen its severity",Influenza
But antibodies against flu viruses you've encountered in the past can't protect you from new influenza subtypes that can be very different immunologically from what you had before,Influenza
Seasonal influenza tends to target young children and older adults,Influenza
Living conditions,Influenza
"People who live in facilities along with many other residents, such as nursing homes or military barracks, are more likely to develop influenza",Influenza
"Cancer treatments, anti-rejection drugs, corticosteroids and HIV/AIDS can weaken your immune system",Influenza
This can make it easier for you to catch influenza and may also increase your risk of developing complications,Influenza
Chronic illnesses,Influenza
"Chronic conditions, such as asthma, diabetes or heart problems, may increase your risk of influenza complications",Influenza
"Pregnant women are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters",Influenza
Women who are two weeks postpartum are also more likely to develop influenza-related complications,Influenza
People with a BMI of 40 or more have an increased risk of complications from the flu,Influenza
"Although you may feel miserable while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects",Influenza
But high-risk children and adults may develop complications such as: Pneumonia Bronchitis Asthma flare-ups Heart problems Ear infections Pneumonia is the most serious complication,Influenza
"For older adults and people with a chronic illness, pneumonia can be deadly",Influenza
"Less often, laryngitis symptoms are caused by something more serious or long lasting",Laryngitis
Strenuous use of your voice during an episode of acute laryngitis can damage your vocal cords,Laryngitis
Make an appointment with a doctor if your laryngitis symptoms last more than two weeks,Laryngitis
"Seek immediate medical attention if you: Have trouble breathing Cough up blood Have a fever that won't go away Have increasing pain Have trouble swallowing Seek immediate medical attention if your child: Makes noisy, high-pitched breathing sounds when inhaling (stridor) Drools more than usual Has trouble swallowing Has difficulty breathing Has a fever higher than 103 F (39",Laryngitis
"Although croup can usually be treated at home, severe symptoms require medical attention",Laryngitis
"These symptoms also can indicate epiglottitis, an inflammation of the tissue that acts as a lid to cover the windpipe (trachea), which can be life-threatening for children and adults",Laryngitis
Leukemia symptoms are often vague and not specific,Leukemia
You may overlook early leukemia symptoms because they may resemble symptoms of the flu and other common illnesses,Leukemia
"Rarely, leukemia may be discovered during blood tests for some other condition",Leukemia
Tickling feeling from movement of hair,Lice infestation
"Lice on your scalp, body, clothing, or pubic or other body hair",Lice infestation
Adult lice may be about the size of a sesame seed or slightly larger,Lice infestation
Nits resemble tiny pussy willow buds,Lice infestation
"Nits can be mistaken for dandruff, but unlike dandruff, they can't be easily brushed out of hair",Lice infestation
"Small red bumps on the scalp, neck and shoulders",Lice infestation
"However, see your doctor if: Nonprescription shampoo doesn't kill the lice â€” your doctor can prescribe a stronger, prescription shampoo You're pregnant â€” don't use any anti-lice shampoo until you talk to your doctor You have any infected hives or skin abrasions from scratching  ",Lice infestation
"If you have consistently low readings but feel fine, your doctor is likely to monitor you during routine exams",Low blood pressure
"Even occasional dizziness or lightheadedness may be a relatively minor problem â€” the result of mild dehydration from too much time in the sun or a hot tub, for example",Low blood pressure
"In these situations, it's not a matter so much of how far, but of how quickly, your blood pressure drops",Low blood pressure
"Still, it's important to see your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms of hypotension because they sometimes can point to more-serious problems",Low blood pressure
"It can be helpful to keep a record of your symptoms, when they occur and what you were doing at the time",Low blood pressure
"Early signs and symptoms A small, red bump often appears at the site of a tick bite or tick removal and resolves over a few days",Lyme disease
This is normal after a tick bite and does not indicate Lyme disease,Lyme disease
"However, these signs and symptoms may occur within a month after you've been infected: Rash",Lyme disease
"From 3 to 30 days after an infected tick bite, an expanding red area might appear that sometimes clears in the center, forming a bullâ€™s-eye pattern",Lyme disease
The rash (erythema migrans) expands slowly over days and can spread to 12 inches (30 centimeters) across,Lyme disease
It is typically not itchy or painful,Lyme disease
Erythema migrans is one of the hallmarks of Lyme disease,Lyme disease
Some people develop this rash at more than one place on their bodies,Lyme disease
Flu-like symptoms,Lyme disease
"Fever, chills, fatigue, body aches and a headache may accompany the rash",Lyme disease
"Later signs and symptoms If untreated, new signs and symptoms of Lyme infection might appear in the following weeks to months",Lyme disease
These include: Erythema migrans appearing in other areas of your body,Lyme disease
appearing in other areas of your body,Lyme disease
Joint pain,Lyme disease
"Bouts of severe joint pain and swelling are especially likely to affect your knees, but the pain can shift from one joint to another",Lyme disease
Neurological problems,Lyme disease
"Weeks, months or even years after infection, you might develop inflammation of the membranes surrounding your brain (meningitis), temporary paralysis of one side of your face (Bell's palsy), numbness or weakness in your limbs, and impaired muscle movement",Lyme disease
"Signs and symptoms caused by the bacterium Borrelia mayonii may also include: Nausea and vomiting Diffuse rashes (rather than a single bull's-eye rash commonly associated with Lyme disease) Less common signs and symptoms Several weeks after infection, some people develop: Heart problems, such as an irregular heartbeat",Lyme disease
Heart problems rarely last more than a few days or weeks,Lyme disease
Eye inflammation,Lyme disease
Liver inflammation (hepatitis),Lyme disease
Severe fatigue,Lyme disease
"The longer the tick remains attached to your skin, the greater your risk of getting the disease",Lyme disease
Lyme infection is unlikely if the tick is attached for less than 36 to 48 hours,Lyme disease
If you think you've been bitten and have signs and symptoms of Lyme disease â€” particularly if you live in an area where Lyme disease is prevalent â€” contact your doctor,Lyme disease
Treatment for Lyme disease is more effective if begun early,Lyme disease
See your doctor even if symptoms disappear It's important to consult your doctor even if signs and symptoms disappear â€” the absence of symptoms doesn't mean the disease is gone,Lyme disease
"Left untreated, Lyme disease can spread to other parts of your body from several months to years after infection, causing arthritis and nervous system problems",Lyme disease
"Ticks also can transmit other illnesses, such as babesiosis and Colorado tick fever",Lyme disease
"However, some types of malaria parasites can lie dormant in your body for up to a year",Malaria
The parasites that cause malaria can lie dormant in your body for up to a year,Malaria
"If you have severe symptoms, seek emergency medical attention",Malaria
Mosquito transmission cycle Uninfected mosquito,Malaria
A mosquito becomes infected by feeding on a person who has malaria,Malaria
Transmission of parasite,Malaria
"If you're the next person this mosquito bites, it can transmit malaria parasites to you",Malaria
In the liver,Malaria
The parasites then travel to your liver â€” where some types can lie dormant for as long as a year,Malaria
Into the bloodstream,Malaria
"When the parasites mature, they leave the liver and infect your red blood cells",Malaria
This is when people typically develop malaria symptoms,Malaria
On to the next person,Malaria
"If an uninfected mosquito bites you at this point in the cycle, it will become infected with your malaria parasites and can spread them to the next person it bites",Malaria
Many different subtypes of malaria parasites exist,Malaria
"The variety that causes the most lethal complications is most commonly found in: African countries south of the Sahara Desert The Asian subcontinent Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and Haiti Risks of more severe disease People at increased risk of serious disease include: Young children and infants Travelers coming from areas with no malaria Pregnant women and their unborn children Poverty, lack of knowledge, and little or no access to health care also contribute to malaria deaths worldwide",Malaria
"Immunity can wane Residents of a malaria region may be exposed to the disease so frequently that they acquire a partial immunity, which can lessen the severity of malaria symptoms",Malaria
"However, this partial immunity can disappear if you move to a country where you're no longer frequently exposed to the parasite",Malaria
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 90 percent of all malaria deaths occur in Africa â€” most commonly in children under the age of 5,Malaria
"In most cases, malaria deaths are related to one or more serious complications, including: Cerebral malaria",Malaria
"If parasite-filled blood cells block small blood vessels to your brain (cerebral malaria), swelling of your brain or brain damage may occur",Malaria
Cerebral malaria may cause coma,Malaria
Breathing problems,Malaria
Accumulated fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema) can make it difficult to breathe,Malaria
Organ failure,Malaria
"Malaria can cause your kidneys or liver to fail, or your spleen to rupture",Malaria
Any of these conditions can be life-threatening,Malaria
Anemia,Malaria
"Malaria damages red blood cells, which can result in anemia",Malaria
Low blood sugar,Malaria
"Severe forms of malaria itself can cause low blood sugar, as can quinine â€” one of the most common medications used to combat malaria",Malaria
Very low blood sugar can result in coma or death,Malaria
"Malaria may recur Some varieties of the malaria parasite, which typically cause milder forms of the disease, can persist for years and cause relapses",Malaria
"Signs and symptoms of measles typically include: Fever Dry cough Runny nose Sore throat Inflamed eyes (conjunctivitis) Tiny white spots with bluish-white centers on a red background found inside the mouth on the inner lining of the cheek â€” also called Koplik's spots A skin rash made up of large, flat blotches that often flow into one another The infection occurs in sequential stages over a period of two to three weeks",Measles
Infection and incubation,Measles
"For the first 10 to 14 days after you're infected, the measles virus incubates",Measles
You have no signs or symptoms of measles during this time,Measles
Nonspecific signs and symptoms,Measles
"Measles typically begins with a mild to moderate fever, often accompanied by a persistent cough, runny nose, inflamed eyes (conjunctivitis) and sore throat",Measles
This relatively mild illness may last two or three days,Measles
Acute illness and rash,Measles
"The rash consists of small red spots, some of which are slightly raised",Measles
Spots and bumps in tight clusters give the skin a splotchy red appearance,Measles
"The face breaks out first, particularly behind the ears and along the hairline",Measles
"Over the next few days, the rash spreads down the arms and trunk, then over the thighs, lower legs and feet",Measles
"At the same time, fever rises sharply, often as high as 104 to 105",Measles
8 F (40 to 41 C),Measles
"The measles rash gradually recedes, fading first from the face and last from the thighs and feet",Measles
Communicable period,Measles
"A person with measles can spread the virus to others for about eight days, starting four days before the rash appears and ending when the rash has been present for four days",Measles
"Review your family's immunization records with your doctor, especially before starting elementary school, before college and before international travel",Measles
"They most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as your back, legs, arms and face",Melanoma
"Melanomas can also occur in areas that don't receive much sun exposure, such as the soles of your feet, palms of your hands and fingernail beds",Melanoma
These hidden melanomas are more common in people with darker skin,Melanoma
The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are: A change in an existing mole The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin Melanoma doesn't always begin as a mole,Melanoma
It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin,Melanoma
"Normal moles Normal moles are generally a uniform color â€” such as tan, brown or black â€” with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin",Melanoma
They're oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter â€” the size of a pencil eraser,Melanoma
Most people have between 10 and 45 moles,Melanoma
"Many of these develop by age 50, although moles may change in appearance over time â€” some may even disappear with age",Melanoma
"Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma To help you identify characteristics of unusual moles that may indicate melanomas or other skin cancers, think of the letters ABCDE: A is for asymmetrical shape",Melanoma
"Look for moles with irregular shapes, such as two very different-looking halves",Melanoma
B is for irregular border,Melanoma
"Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders â€” characteristics of melanomas",Melanoma
C is for changes in color,Melanoma
Look for growths that have many colors or an uneven distribution of color,Melanoma
D is for diameter,Melanoma
Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters),Melanoma
E is for evolving,Melanoma
"Look for changes over time, such as a mole that grows in size or that changes color or shape",Melanoma
"Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding",Melanoma
Cancerous (malignant) moles vary greatly in appearance,Melanoma
"Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics",Melanoma
"Hidden melanomas Melanomas can also develop in areas of your body that have little or no exposure to the sun, such as the spaces between your toes and on your palms, soles, scalp or genitals",Melanoma
These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn't think to check,Melanoma
"When melanoma occurs in people with darker skin, it's more likely to occur in a hidden area",Melanoma
Hidden melanomas include: Melanoma under a nail,Melanoma
Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail,Melanoma
It can also be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet,Melanoma
It's more common in blacks and in other people with darker skin pigment,Melanoma
"Melanoma in the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract or vagina",Melanoma
"Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane that lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina",Melanoma
Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions,Melanoma
Melanoma in the eye,Melanoma
"Eye melanoma, also called ocular melanoma, most often occurs in the uvea â€” the layer beneath the white of the eye (sclera)",Melanoma
An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam,Melanoma
"Possible signs and symptoms in anyone older than the age of 2 include: Sudden high fever Stiff neck Severe headache that seems different than normal Headache with nausea or vomiting Confusion or difficulty concentrating Seizures Sleepiness or difficulty waking Sensitivity to light No appetite or thirst Skin rash (sometimes, such as in meningococcal meningitis) Signs in newborns Newborns and infants may show these signs: High fever Constant crying Excessive sleepiness or irritability Inactivity or sluggishness Poor feeding A bulge in the soft spot on top of a baby's head (fontanel) Stiffness in a baby's body and neck Infants with meningitis may be difficult to comfort, and may even cry harder when held",Meningitis
Delayed treatment increases the risk of permanent brain damage or death,Meningitis
It's also important to talk to your doctor if a family member or someone you work with has meningitis,Meningitis
You may need to take medications to prevent getting the infection,Meningitis
"Because bacterial infections can be life-threatening, identifying the cause is essential",Meningitis
Bacterial meningitis Bacteria that enter the bloodstream and travel to the brain and spinal cord cause acute bacterial meningitis,Meningitis
But it can also occur when bacteria directly invade the meninges,Meningitis
"This may be caused by an ear or sinus infection, a skull fracture, or, rarely, after some surgeries",Meningitis
"Several strains of bacteria can cause acute bacterial meningitis, most commonly: Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus)",Meningitis
"This bacterium is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in infants, young children and adults in the United States",Meningitis
It more commonly causes pneumonia or ear or sinus infections,Meningitis
A vaccine can help prevent this infection,Meningitis
Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus),Meningitis
This bacterium is another leading cause of bacterial meningitis,Meningitis
These bacteria commonly cause an upper respiratory infection but can cause meningococcal meningitis when they enter the bloodstream,Meningitis
This is a highly contagious infection that affects mainly teenagers and young adults,Meningitis
"It may cause local epidemics in college dormitories, boarding schools and military bases",Meningitis
A vaccine can help prevent infection,Meningitis
Haemophilus influenzae (haemophilus),Meningitis
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacterium was once the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children,Meningitis
But new Hib vaccines have greatly reduced the number of cases of this type of meningitis,Meningitis
Listeria monocytogenes (listeria),Meningitis
"These bacteria can be found in unpasteurized cheeses, hot dogs and luncheon meats",Meningitis
"Pregnant women, newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are most susceptible",Meningitis
"Listeria can cross the placental barrier, and infections in late pregnancy may be fatal to the baby",Meningitis
Viral meningitis Viral meningitis is usually mild and often clears on its own,Meningitis
"Most cases in the United States are caused by a group of viruses known as enteroviruses, which are most common in late summer and early fall",Meningitis
"Viruses such as herpes simplex virus, HIV, mumps, West Nile virus and others also can cause viral meningitis",Meningitis
Chronic meningitis Slow-growing organisms (such as fungi and Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that invade the membranes and fluid surrounding your brain cause chronic meningitis,Meningitis
Chronic meningitis develops over two weeks or more,Meningitis
"The symptoms of chronic meningitis â€” headaches, fever, vomiting and mental cloudiness â€” are similar to those of acute meningitis",Meningitis
Fungal meningitis Fungal meningitis is relatively uncommon and causes chronic meningitis,Meningitis
It may mimic acute bacterial meningitis,Meningitis
Fungal meningitis isn't contagious from person to person,Meningitis
"Cryptococcal meningitis is a common fungal form of the disease that affects people with immune deficiencies, such as AIDS",Meningitis
It's life-threatening if not treated with an antifungal medication,Meningitis
"Other meningitis causes Meningitis can also result from noninfectious causes, such as chemical reactions, drug allergies, some types of cancer and inflammatory diseases such as sarcoidosis",Meningitis
Risk rises for anyone who hasn't completed the recommended childhood or adult vaccination schedule,Meningitis
Most cases of viral meningitis occur in children younger than age 5,Meningitis
Bacterial meningitis is common in those under age 20,Meningitis
Living in a community setting,Meningitis
"College students living in dormitories, personnel on military bases, and children in boarding schools and child care facilities are at greater risk of meningococcal meningitis",Meningitis
"This is probably because the bacterium is spread by the respiratory route, and spreads quickly through large groups",Meningitis
Pregnancy,Meningitis
"Pregnancy increases the risk of listeriosis â€” an infection caused by listeria bacteria, which also may cause meningitis",Meningitis
"Listeriosis increases the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and premature delivery",Meningitis
Compromised immune system,Meningitis
"AIDS, alcoholism, diabetes, use of immunosuppressant drugs and other factors that affect your immune system also make you more susceptible to meningitis",Meningitis
"Having your spleen removed also increases your risk, and patients without a spleen should get vaccinated to minimize that risk",Meningitis
"The longer you or your child has the disease without treatment, the greater the risk of seizures and permanent neurological damage, including: Hearing loss Memory difficulty Learning disabilities Brain damage Gait problems Seizures Kidney failure Shock Death With prompt treatment, even patients with severe meningitis can have good recovery",Meningitis
"Migraines may progress through four stages: prodrome, aura, headache and post-drome, though you may not experience all stages",Migraine
"Prodrome One or two days before a migraine, you may notice subtle changes that warn of an upcoming migraine, including: Constipation Mood changes, from depression to euphoria Food cravings Neck stiffness Increased thirst and urination Frequent yawning Aura Aura may occur before or during migraines",Migraine
Most people experience migraines without aura,Migraine
Auras are symptoms of the nervous system,Migraine
"They are usually visual disturbances, such as flashes of light or wavy, zigzag vision",Migraine
"Sometimes auras can also be touching sensations (sensory), movement (motor) or speech (verbal) disturbances",Migraine
"Your muscles may get weak, or you may feel as though someone is touching you",Migraine
"Each of these symptoms usually begins gradually, builds up over several minutes and lasts for 20 to 60 minutes",Migraine
"Examples of migraine aura include: Visual phenomena, such as seeing various shapes, bright spots or flashes of light Vision loss Pins and needles sensations in an arm or leg Weakness or numbness in the face or one side of the body Difficulty speaking Hearing noises or music Uncontrollable jerking or other movements Sometimes, a migraine with aura may be associated with limb weakness (hemiplegic migraine)",Migraine
Attack A migraine usually lasts from four to 72 hours if untreated,Migraine
The frequency with which headaches occur varies from person to person,Migraine
"Migraines may be rare, or strike several times a month",Migraine
"During a migraine, you may experience: Pain on one side or both sides of your head Pain that feels throbbing or pulsing Sensitivity to light, sounds, and sometimes smells and touch Nausea and vomiting Blurred vision Lightheadedness, sometimes followed by fainting Post-drome The final phase, known as post-drome, occurs after a migraine attack",Migraine
"You may feel drained and washed out, while some people feel elated",Migraine
"If you regularly experience signs and symptoms of migraine attacks, keep a record of your attacks and how you treated them",Migraine
Then make an appointment with your doctor to discuss your headaches,Migraine
"Migraines may be caused by changes in the brainstem and its interactions with the trigeminal nerve, a major pain pathway",Migraine
"Imbalances in brain chemicals â€” including serotonin, which helps regulate pain in your nervous system â€” also may be involved",Migraine
Researchers are still studying the role of serotonin in migraines,Migraine
Serotonin levels drop during migraine attacks,Migraine
"This may cause your trigeminal nerve to release substances called neuropeptides, which travel to your brain's outer covering (meninges)",Migraine
The result is migraine pain,Migraine
"Other neurotransmitters play a role in the pain of migraine, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)",Migraine
"Migraine triggers A number of factors may trigger migraines, including: Hormonal changes in women",Migraine
Fluctuations in estrogen seem to trigger headaches in many women,Migraine
"Women with a history of migraines often report headaches immediately before or during their periods, when they have a major drop in estrogen",Migraine
Others have an increased tendency to develop migraines during pregnancy or menopause,Migraine
"Hormonal medications, such as oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, also may worsen migraines",Migraine
"Some women, however, find their migraines occur less often when taking these medications",Migraine
Foods,Migraine
"Aged cheeses, salty foods and processed foods may trigger migraines",Migraine
Skipping meals or fasting also can trigger attacks,Migraine
Food additives,Migraine
"The sweetener aspartame and the preservative monosodium glutamate (MSG), found in many foods, may trigger migraines",Migraine
Drinks,Migraine
"Alcohol, especially wine, and highly caffeinated beverages may trigger migraines",Migraine
Stress,Migraine
Stress at work or home can cause migraines,Migraine
Sensory stimuli,Migraine
"Bright lights and sun glare can induce migraines, as can loud sounds",Migraine
"Strong smells â€” including perfume, paint thinner, secondhand smoke and others â€” can trigger migraines in some people",Migraine
Changes in wake-sleep pattern,Migraine
"Missing sleep or getting too much sleep may trigger migraines in some people, as can jet lag",Migraine
Physical factors,Migraine
"Intense physical exertion, including sexual activity, may provoke migraines",Migraine
Changes in the environment,Migraine
A change of weather or barometric pressure can prompt a migraine,Migraine
"Oral contraceptives and vasodilators, such as nitroglycerin, can aggravate migraines",Migraine
"If you have a family member with migraines, then you have a good chance of developing them too",Migraine
"Migraines can begin at any age, though the first often occurs during adolescence",Migraine
"Migraines tend to peak during your 30s, and gradually become less severe and less frequent in the following decades",Migraine
Women are three times more likely to have migraines,Migraine
"Headaches tend to affect boys more than girls during childhood, but by the time of puberty and beyond, more girls are affected",Migraine
Hormonal changes,Migraine
"If you are a woman who has migraines, you may find that your headaches begin just before or shortly after onset of menstruation",Migraine
They may also change during pregnancy or menopause,Migraine
Migraines generally improve after menopause,Migraine
"Some women report that migraine attacks begin during pregnancy, or their attacks worsen",Migraine
"For many, the attacks improved or didn't occur during later stages in the pregnancy",Migraine
Migraines often return during the postpartum period,Migraine
"Certain pain relievers called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), may cause abdominal pain, bleeding, ulcers and other complications, especially if taken in large doses or for a long period of time",Migraine
Medication-overuse headaches,Migraine
Taking over-the-counter or prescription headache medications more than 10 days a month for three months or in high doses may trigger serious medication-overuse headaches,Migraine
Medication-overuse headaches occur when medications stop relieving pain and begin to cause headaches,Migraine
"You then use more pain medication, which continues the cycle",Migraine
Serotonin syndrome,Migraine
"Serotonin syndrome is a rare, potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when your body has too much of the nervous system chemical called serotonin",Migraine
"While the risk is considered extremely low, taking migraine medications called triptans and antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome",Migraine
"These medications naturally raise serotonin levels, and it is possible that combining them could cause levels that are too high",Migraine
"Triptans and SSRIs or SNRIs may be used together, but it's important to watch out for possible symptoms of serotonin syndrome such as changes in cognition, behavior and muscle control (such as involuntary jerking)",Migraine
Triptans include medications such as sumatriptan (Imitrex) or zolmitriptan (Zomig),Migraine
"Some common SSRIs include sertraline (Zoloft), fluoxetine (Sarafem, Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil)",Migraine
SNRIs include duloxetine (Cymbalta) and venlafaxine (Effexor XR),Migraine
"Also, some people experience complications from migraines such as:",Migraine
"However, it's possible â€” and even somewhat more likely â€” to have chronic sinusitis without nasal polyps",Nasal polyps
"Nasal polyps themselves are soft and lack sensation, so if they're small you may not be aware you have them",Nasal polyps
Multiple growths or a large polyp may block your nasal passages and sinuses,Nasal polyps
It's not clear why some people develop chronic inflammation or why ongoing inflammation triggers polyp formation in some people and not in others,Nasal polyps
The inflammation occurs in the fluid-producing lining (mucous membrane) of your nose and sinuses,Nasal polyps
There's some evidence that people who develop polyps have a different immune system response and different chemical markers in their mucous membranes than do those who don't develop polyps,Nasal polyps
"Nasal polyps can form at any age, but they're most common in young and middle-aged adults",Nasal polyps
"Nasal polyps may form anywhere in your sinuses or nasal passages, but they appear most often in an area where sinuses near your eyes, nose and cheekbones all drain through winding passages into your nose (ostiomeatal complex)",Nasal polyps
"Conditions often associated with nasal polyps include: Asthma, a disease that causes overall airway inflammation and constriction a disease that causes overall airway inflammation and constriction Aspirin sensitivity may cause some people to be more likely to develop nasal polyps may cause some people to be more likely to develop nasal polyps Allergic fungal sinusitis, an allergy to airborne fungi an allergy to airborne fungi Cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that results in the production and secretion of abnormally thick, sticky fluids, including thick mucus from nasal and sinus membranes a genetic disorder that results in the production and secretion of abnormally thick, sticky fluids, including thick mucus from nasal and sinus membranes Churg-Strauss syndrome, a rare disease that causes the inflammation of blood vessels Your family history also may play a role",Nasal polyps
There's some evidence that certain genetic variations associated with immune system function make you more likely to develop nasal polyps,Nasal polyps
Potential complications include:,Nasal polyps
"When you're young, your body makes new bone faster than it breaks down old bone and your bone mass increases",Osteoporosis
Most people reach their peak bone mass by their early 20s,Osteoporosis
"As people age, bone mass is lost faster than it's created",Osteoporosis
How likely you are to develop osteoporosis depends partly on how much bone mass you attained in your youth,Osteoporosis
"The higher your peak bone mass, the more bone you have in the bank and the less likely you are to develop osteoporosis as you age",Osteoporosis
"Unchangeable risks Some risk factors for osteoporosis are out of your control, including: Your sex",Osteoporosis
Women are much more likely to develop osteoporosis than are men,Osteoporosis
"The older you get, the greater your risk of osteoporosis",Osteoporosis
You're at greatest risk of osteoporosis if you're white or of Asian descent,Osteoporosis
"Having a parent or sibling with osteoporosis puts you at greater risk, especially if your mother or father experienced a hip fracture",Osteoporosis
Body frame size,Osteoporosis
Men and women who have small body frames tend to have a higher risk because they may have less bone mass to draw from as they age,Osteoporosis
Hormone levels Osteoporosis is more common in people who have too much or too little of certain hormones in their bodies,Osteoporosis
Examples include: Sex hormones,Osteoporosis
Lowered sex hormone levels tend to weaken bone,Osteoporosis
The reduction of estrogen levels in women at menopause is one of the strongest risk factors for developing osteoporosis,Osteoporosis
Men experience a gradual reduction in testosterone levels as they age,Osteoporosis
Treatments for prostate cancer that reduce testosterone levels in men and treatments for breast cancer that reduce estrogen levels in women are likely to accelerate bone loss,Osteoporosis
Thyroid problems,Osteoporosis
Too much thyroid hormone can cause bone loss,Osteoporosis
This can occur if your thyroid is overactive or if you take too much thyroid hormone medication to treat an underactive thyroid,Osteoporosis
Other glands,Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis has also been associated with overactive parathyroid and adrenal glands,Osteoporosis
Dietary factors Osteoporosis is more likely to occur in people who have: Low calcium intake,Osteoporosis
A lifelong lack of calcium plays a role in the development of osteoporosis,Osteoporosis
"Low calcium intake contributes to diminished bone density, early bone loss and an increased risk of fractures",Osteoporosis
Eating disorders,Osteoporosis
Severely restricting food intake and being underweight weakens bone in both men and women,Osteoporosis
Gastrointestinal surgery,Osteoporosis
"Surgery to reduce the size of your stomach or to remove part of the intestine limits the amount of surface area available to absorb nutrients, including calcium",Osteoporosis
"Steroids and other medications Long-term use of oral or injected corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone and cortisone, interferes with the bone-rebuilding process",Osteoporosis
"Osteoporosis has also been associated with medications used to combat or prevent: Seizures Gastric reflux Cancer Transplant rejection Medical conditions The risk of osteoporosis is higher in people who have certain medical problems, including: Celiac disease Inflammatory bowel disease Kidney or liver disease Cancer Lupus Multiple myeloma Rheumatoid arthritis Lifestyle choices Some bad habits can increase your risk of osteoporosis",Osteoporosis
Examples include: Sedentary lifestyle,Osteoporosis
People who spend a lot of time sitting have a higher risk of osteoporosis than do those who are more active,Osteoporosis
"Any weight-bearing exercise and activities that promote balance and good posture are beneficial for your bones, but walking, running, jumping, dancing and weightlifting seem particularly helpful",Osteoporosis
Excessive alcohol consumption,Osteoporosis
Regular consumption of more than two alcoholic drinks a day increases your risk of osteoporosis,Osteoporosis
"The exact role tobacco plays in osteoporosis isn't clearly understood, but it has been shown that tobacco use contributes to weak bones",Osteoporosis
Hip fractures often are caused by a fall and can result in disability and even an increased risk of death within the first year after the injury,Osteoporosis
"In some cases, spinal fractures can occur even if you haven't fallen",Osteoporosis
"The bones that make up your spine (vertebrae) can weaken to the point that they may crumple, which can result in back pain, lost height and a hunched forward posture",Osteoporosis
"Advanced-stage ovarian cancer may cause few and nonspecific symptoms that are often mistaken for more common benign conditions, such as constipation or irritable bowel",Ovarian cancer
"If you have a family history of ovarian cancer or breast cancer, talk to your doctor about your risk of ovarian cancer",Ovarian cancer
Your doctor may refer you to a genetic counselor to discuss testing for certain gene mutations that increase your risk of breast and ovarian cancers,Ovarian cancer
Only a small number of women are found to have genetic mutations that can lead to ovarian cancer,Ovarian cancer
"If your symptoms distress you or disrupt your life, talk to your doctor",Overactive bladder
Treatments are available that might help you,Overactive bladder
"Discussing such a private matter with your doctor might not be easy, but it's worthwhile to take that risk â€” especially if your symptoms disrupt your work schedule, social interactions and everyday activities",Overactive bladder
"When you urinate, urine passes from your bladder through an opening at the bottom and flows out a tube called the urethra (u-REE-thruh)",Overactive bladder
"In women, the urethral opening is located just above the vagina",Overactive bladder
"In men, the urethral opening is at the tip of the penis",Overactive bladder
"As your bladder fills, nerve signals sent to your brain eventually trigger the need to urinate",Overactive bladder
"When you urinate, nerve signals coordinate the relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles and the muscles of the urethra (urinary sphincter muscles)",Overactive bladder
"The muscles of the bladder tighten (contract), pushing the urine out",Overactive bladder
Involuntary bladder contractions Overactive bladder occurs because the muscles of the bladder start to contract involuntarily even when the volume of urine in your bladder is low,Overactive bladder
This involuntary contraction creates the urgent need to urinate,Overactive bladder
"You're also at higher risk of diseases and disorders, such as enlarged prostate and diabetes, which can contribute to other problems with bladder function",Overactive bladder
"Many people with cognitive decline â€” for instance, after a stroke or with Alzheimer's disease â€” develop an overactive bladder",Overactive bladder
"Incontinence that results from situations like this can be managed with fluid schedules, timed and prompted voiding, absorbent garments, and bowel programs",Overactive bladder
Some people with an overactive bladder also have bowel control problems; tell your doctor if this is a problem for you,Overactive bladder
"If your overactive bladder symptoms cause a major disruption to your life, you might also have: Emotional distress or depression Anxiety Sleep disturbances and interrupted sleep cycles Issues with sexuality Your doctor might recommend treatment of associated conditions, to see if effective treatment of an associated condition will help with your urinary symptoms",Overactive bladder
"Some women also may have a disorder called mixed incontinence, when both urge and stress incontinence occur",Overactive bladder
"Stress incontinence is the loss of urine when you exert physical stress or pressure on your bladder, such as during activities that include running or jumping",Overactive bladder
Treatment of the stress incontinence is not likely to help the overactive bladder symptoms,Overactive bladder
Older people may have a common combination of bladder storage problems and bladder-emptying issues,Overactive bladder
"The bladder may cause a lot of urgency and even incontinence, but it doesn't empty well",Overactive bladder
A specialist may be able to help you with this combination of bladder problems,Overactive bladder
"Many conditions can cause these symptoms, so your doctor may check for these conditions as well as for pancreatic cancer",Pancreatic cancer
"Doctors have identified factors, such as smoking, that increase your risk of developing the disease",Pancreatic cancer
Understanding your pancreas Your pancreas is about 6 inches (15 centimeters) long and looks something like a pear lying on its side,Pancreatic cancer
"It releases (secretes) hormones, including insulin, to help your body process sugar in the foods you eat",Pancreatic cancer
And it produces digestive juices to help your body digest food,Pancreatic cancer
How pancreatic cancer forms Pancreatic cancer occurs when cells in your pancreas develop mutations in their DNA,Pancreatic cancer
These mutations cause cells to grow uncontrollably and to continue living after normal cells would die,Pancreatic cancer
These accumulating cells can form a tumor,Pancreatic cancer
Untreated pancreatic cancer spreads to nearby organs and blood vessels,Pancreatic cancer
Most pancreatic cancer begins in the cells that line the ducts of the pancreas,Pancreatic cancer
This type of cancer is called pancreatic adenocarcinoma or pancreatic exocrine cancer,Pancreatic cancer
"Rarely, cancer can form in the hormone-producing cells or the neuroendocrine cells of the pancreas",Pancreatic cancer
"These types of cancer are called islet cell tumors, pancreatic endocrine cancer and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors",Pancreatic cancer
Seek immediate medical help if your abdominal pain is so severe that you can't sit still or find a position that makes you more comfortable,Pancreatitis
"With repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis, damage to the pancreas can occur and lead to chronic pancreatitis",Pancreatitis
"Scar tissue may form in the pancreas, causing loss of function",Pancreatitis
A poorly functioning pancreas can cause digestion problems and diabetes,Pancreatitis
"Conditions that can lead to pancreatitis include: Alcoholism Gallstones Abdominal surgery Certain medications Cigarette smoking Cystic fibrosis Family history of pancreatitis High calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcemia), which may be caused by an overactive parathyroid gland (hyperparathyroidism) High triglyceride levels in the blood (hypertriglyceridemia) Infection Injury to the abdomen Pancreatic cancer Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a procedure used to treat gallstones, also can lead to pancreatitis",Pancreatitis
"Sometimes, a cause for pancreatitis is never found",Pancreatitis
"Stomach acid makes the pain worse, as does having an empty stomach",Peptic ulcer
"The pain can often be relieved by eating certain foods that buffer stomach acid or by taking an acid-reducing medication, but then it may come back",Peptic ulcer
The pain may be worse between meals and at night,Peptic ulcer
Nearly three-quarters of people with peptic ulcers don't have symptoms,Peptic ulcer
Also see your doctor if over-the-counter antacids and acid blockers relieve your pain but the pain returns,Peptic ulcer
The acid can create a painful open sore that may bleed,Peptic ulcer
Your digestive tract is coated with a mucous layer that normally protects against acid,Peptic ulcer
"But if the amount of acid is increased or the amount of mucus is decreased, you could develop an ulcer",Peptic ulcer
Common causes include: A bacterium,Peptic ulcer
Helicobacter pylori bacteria commonly live in the mucous layer that covers and protects tissues that line the stomach and small intestine,Peptic ulcer
"Often, the H",Peptic ulcer
"pylori bacterium causes no problems, but it can cause inflammation of the stomach's inner layer, producing an ulcer",Peptic ulcer
It's not clear how H,Peptic ulcer
pylori infection spreads,Peptic ulcer
"It may be transmitted from person to person by close contact, such as kissing",Peptic ulcer
People may also contract H,Peptic ulcer
pylori through food and water,Peptic ulcer
Regular use of certain pain relievers,Peptic ulcer
"Taking aspirin, as well as certain over-the-counter and prescription pain medications called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can irritate or inflame the lining of your stomach and small intestine",Peptic ulcer
"These medications include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox, others), but not acetaminophen (Tylenol)",Peptic ulcer
Peptic ulcers are more common in older adults who take these pain medications frequently or in people who take these medications for osteoarthritis,Peptic ulcer
Other medications,Peptic ulcer
"Taking certain other medications along with NSAIDs, such as steroids, anticoagulants, low-dose aspirin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), alendronate (Fosamax) and risedronate (Actonel), can greatly increase the chance of developing ulcers",Peptic ulcer
Smoking may increase the risk of peptic ulcers in people who are infected with H,Peptic ulcer
Drink alcohol,Peptic ulcer
"Alcohol can irritate and erode the mucous lining of your stomach, and it increases the amount of stomach acid that's produced",Peptic ulcer
Have untreated stress,Peptic ulcer
Eat spicy foods,Peptic ulcer
"Alone, these factors do not cause ulcers, but they can make them worse and more difficult to heal",Peptic ulcer
"Chronic periodontitis is the most common class, affecting mostly adults, though children can be affected, too",Periodontitis
Aggressive periodontitis usually begins in childhood or early adulthood and affects only a small number of people,Periodontitis
When to see a dentist Healthy gums are firm and pale pink,Periodontitis
"If your gums are puffy, dusky red and bleed easily, or show other signs or symptoms of periodontitis, see your dentist soon",Periodontitis
"The sooner you seek care, the better your chances of reversing damage from periodontitis, potentially preventing other serious health problems",Periodontitis
Pink eye can be highly contagious for as long as two weeks after signs and symptoms begin,Pink eye
Early diagnosis and treatment can protect people around you from getting pink eye too,Pink eye
"If you wear contact lenses, stop using them as soon as your symptoms begin",Pink eye
"If your eyes don't get better within 12 to 24 hours, make an appointment with your eye doctor",Pink eye
He or she can check whether you have a more serious eye infection related to contact lens use,Pink eye
"In addition, other serious eye conditions can cause eye redness",Pink eye
"Seek urgent care if you also experience pain, light sensitivity or blurred vision",Pink eye
"Mild signs and symptoms often are similar to those of a cold or flu, but they last longer",Pneumonia
"Signs and symptoms of pneumonia may include: Chest pain when you breathe or cough Confusion or changes in mental awareness (in adults age 65 and older) Cough, which may produce phlegm Fatigue Fever, sweating and shaking chills Lower than normal body temperature (in adults older than age 65 and people with weak immune systems) Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Shortness of breath Newborns and infants may not show any sign of the infection",Pneumonia
"Or they may vomit, have a fever and cough, appear restless or tired and without energy, or have difficulty breathing and eating",Pneumonia
"It's especially important that people in these high-risk groups see a doctor: Adults older than age 65 Children younger than age 2 with signs and symptoms People with an underlying health condition or weakened immune system People receiving chemotherapy or taking medication that suppresses the immune system For some older adults and people with heart failure or chronic lung problems, pneumonia can quickly become a life-threatening condition",Pneumonia
The most common are bacteria and viruses in the air we breathe,Pneumonia
Your body usually prevents these germs from infecting your lungs,Pneumonia
"But sometimes these germs can overpower your immune system, even if your health is generally good",Pneumonia
Pneumonia is classified according to the types of germs that cause it and where you got the infection,Pneumonia
Community-acquired pneumonia Community-acquired pneumonia is the most common type of pneumonia,Pneumonia
It occurs outside of hospitals or other health care facilities,Pneumonia
It may be caused by: Bacteria,Pneumonia
The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in the U,Pneumonia
is Streptococcus pneumoniae,Pneumonia
This type of pneumonia can occur on its own or after you've had a cold or the flu,Pneumonia
"It may affect one part (lobe) of the lung, a condition called lobar pneumonia",Pneumonia
Bacteria-like organisms,Pneumonia
Mycoplasma pneumoniae also can cause pneumonia,Pneumonia
It typically produces milder symptoms than do other types of pneumonia,Pneumonia
"Walking pneumonia is an informal name given to this type of pneumonia, which typically isn't severe enough to require bed rest",Pneumonia
Fungi,Pneumonia
"This type of pneumonia is most common in people with chronic health problems or weakened immune systems, and in people who have inhaled large doses of the organisms",Pneumonia
The fungi that cause it can be found in soil or bird droppings and vary depending upon geographic location,Pneumonia
Viruses,Pneumonia
Some of the viruses that cause colds and the flu can cause pneumonia,Pneumonia
Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years,Pneumonia
Viral pneumonia is usually mild,Pneumonia
But in some cases it can become very serious,Pneumonia
Hospital-acquired pneumonia Some people catch pneumonia during a hospital stay for another illness,Pneumonia
Hospital-acquired pneumonia can be serious because the bacteria causing it may be more resistant to antibiotics and because the people who get it are already sick,Pneumonia
"People who are on breathing machines (ventilators), often used in intensive care units, are at higher risk of this type of pneumonia",Pneumonia
"Health care-acquired pneumonia Health care-acquired pneumonia is a bacterial infection that occurs in people who live in long-term care facilities or who receive care in outpatient clinics, including kidney dialysis centers",Pneumonia
"Like hospital-acquired pneumonia, health care-acquired pneumonia can be caused by bacteria that are more resistant to antibiotics",Pneumonia
"Aspiration pneumonia Aspiration pneumonia occurs when you inhale food, drink, vomit or saliva into your lungs",Pneumonia
"Aspiration is more likely if something disturbs your normal gag reflex, such as a brain injury or swallowing problem, or excessive use of alcohol or drugs",Pneumonia
But the two age groups at highest risk are: Children who are 2 years old or younger People who are age 65 or older Other risk factors include: Being hospitalized,Pneumonia
"You're at greater risk of pneumonia if you're in a hospital intensive care unit, especially if you're on a machine that helps you breathe (a ventilator)",Pneumonia
Chronic disease,Pneumonia
"You're more likely to get pneumonia if you have asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) or heart disease",Pneumonia
"You're more likely to get pneumonia if you have asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( ) or heart disease",Pneumonia
Smoking damages your body's natural defenses against the bacteria and viruses that cause pneumonia,Pneumonia
Weakened or suppressed immune system,Pneumonia
"People who have HIV / AIDS , who've had an organ transplant, or who receive chemotherapy or long-term steroids are at risk",Pneumonia
"There is debate regarding the risks and benefits of screening for prostate cancer, and medical organizations differ on their recommendations",Prostate cancer
Discuss prostate cancer screening with your doctor,Prostate cancer
"Together, you can decide what's best for you",Prostate cancer
Some people become ill very quickly with severe disease,Pulmonary fibrosis
"Others have moderate symptoms that worsen more slowly, over months or years",Pulmonary fibrosis
"Some people may experience a rapid worsening of their symptoms (acute exacerbation), such as severe shortness of breath, that may last for several days to weeks",Pulmonary fibrosis
People who have acute exacerbations may be placed on a mechanical ventilator,Pulmonary fibrosis
"Doctors may also prescribe antibiotics, corticosteroid medications or other medications to treat an acute exacerbation",Pulmonary fibrosis
This makes it more difficult for oxygen to pass into your bloodstream,Pulmonary fibrosis
"The damage can be caused by many different factors â€” including long-term exposure to certain toxins, certain medical conditions, radiation therapy and some medications",Pulmonary fibrosis
Occupational and environmental factors Long-term exposure to a number of toxins and pollutants can damage your lungs,Pulmonary fibrosis
These include: Silica dust Asbestos fibers Hard metal dusts Coal dust Grain dust Bird and animal droppings Radiation treatments Some people who receive radiation therapy for lung or breast cancer show signs of lung damage months or sometimes years after the initial treatment,Pulmonary fibrosis
"The severity of the damage may depend on: How much of the lung was exposed to radiation The total amount of radiation administered Whether chemotherapy also was used The presence of underlying lung disease Medications Many drugs can damage your lungs, especially medications such as: Chemotherapy drugs",Pulmonary fibrosis
"Drugs designed to kill cancer cells, such as methotrexate (Trexall, Otrexup, others) and cyclophosphamide, can also damage lung tissue",Pulmonary fibrosis
Heart medications,Pulmonary fibrosis
"Some drugs used to treat irregular heartbeats, such as amiodarone (Cordarone, Nexterone, Pacerone), may harm lung tissue",Pulmonary fibrosis
Some antibiotics,Pulmonary fibrosis
"Antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin (Macrobid, Macrodantin, others) or ethambutol can cause lung damage",Pulmonary fibrosis
Anti-inflammatory drugs,Pulmonary fibrosis
Certain anti-inflammatory drugs such as rituximab (Rituxan) or sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) can cause lung damage,Pulmonary fibrosis
"Medical conditions Lung damage can also result from a number of conditions, including: Dermatomyositis Polymyositis Mixed connective tissue disease Systemic lupus erythematosus Rheumatoid arthritis Sarcoidosis Scleroderma Pneumonia Many substances and conditions can lead to pulmonary fibrosis",Pulmonary fibrosis
"Even so, in most cases, the cause is never found",Pulmonary fibrosis
Pulmonary fibrosis with no known cause is called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,Pulmonary fibrosis
"Researchers have several theories about what might trigger idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, including viruses and exposure to tobacco smoke",Pulmonary fibrosis
"Also, some forms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis run in families, and heredity may play a role in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis",Pulmonary fibrosis
Many people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may also have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) â€” a condition that occurs when acid from your stomach flows back into your esophagus,Pulmonary fibrosis
"Ongoing research is evaluating if GERD may be a risk factor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or if GERD may lead to a more rapid progression of the condition",Pulmonary fibrosis
"However, more research is needed to determine the association between idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and GERD",Pulmonary fibrosis
"Although pulmonary fibrosis has been diagnosed in children and infants, the disorder is much more likely to affect middle-aged and older adults",Pulmonary fibrosis
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is more likely to affect men than women,Pulmonary fibrosis
Far more smokers and former smokers develop pulmonary fibrosis than do people who have never smoked,Pulmonary fibrosis
Pulmonary fibrosis can occur in patients with emphysema,Pulmonary fibrosis
Certain occupations,Pulmonary fibrosis
"You have an increased risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis if you work in mining, farming or construction or if you're exposed to pollutants known to damage your lungs",Pulmonary fibrosis
Cancer treatments,Pulmonary fibrosis
Having radiation treatments to your chest or using certain chemotherapy drugs can increase your risk of pulmonary fibrosis,Pulmonary fibrosis
Genetic factors,Pulmonary fibrosis
"Some types of pulmonary fibrosis run in families, and genetic factors may be a component",Pulmonary fibrosis
"As the disease progresses, symptoms become worse",Pulmonary hypertension
"Each time blood passes through your heart, the lower right chamber (right ventricle) pumps blood to your lungs through a large blood vessel (pulmonary artery)",Pulmonary hypertension
"Chambers and valves of the heart Chambers and valves of the heart In your lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen",Pulmonary hypertension
"The oxygen-rich blood then flows through blood vessels in your lungs (pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins) to the left side of your heart",Pulmonary hypertension
"Ordinarily, the blood flows easily through the vessels in your lungs, so blood pressure is usually much lower in your lungs",Pulmonary hypertension
"With pulmonary hypertension, the rise in blood pressure is caused by changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries",Pulmonary hypertension
"These changes can cause the walls of the arteries to become stiff and thick, and extra tissue may form",Pulmonary hypertension
The blood vessels may also become inflamed and tight,Pulmonary hypertension
These changes in the pulmonary arteries can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels,Pulmonary hypertension
"This makes it harder for blood to flow, raising the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries",Pulmonary hypertension
"Pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary hypertension is classified into five groups, depending on the cause",Pulmonary hypertension
"It's most commonly caused by a large hole in your heart between the two lower heart chambers (ventricles), called a ventricular septal defect",Pulmonary hypertension
This hole in your heart causes blood to circulate abnormally in your heart,Pulmonary hypertension
Oxygen-carrying blood (red blood) mixes with oxygen-poor blood (blue blood),Pulmonary hypertension
"The blood then returns to your lungs instead of going to the rest of your body, increasing the pressure in the pulmonary arteries and causing pulmonary hypertension",Pulmonary hypertension
"As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders",Rheumatoid arthritis
"In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body",Rheumatoid arthritis
About 40 percent of the people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don't involve the joints,Rheumatoid arthritis
"Rheumatoid arthritis can affect many nonjoint structures, including: Skin Eyes Lungs Heart Kidneys Salivary glands Nerve tissue Bone marrow Blood vessels Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go",Rheumatoid arthritis
"Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission â€” when the swelling and pain fade or disappear",Rheumatoid arthritis
"Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place",Rheumatoid arthritis
osteoarthritis Rheumatoid arthritis vs,Rheumatoid arthritis
osteoarthritis Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system attacks the synovium â€” the lining of the membranes that surround your joints,Rheumatoid arthritis
"The resulting inflammation thickens the synovium, which can eventually destroy the cartilage and bone within the joint",Rheumatoid arthritis
The tendons and ligaments that hold the joint together weaken and stretch,Rheumatoid arthritis
"Gradually, the joint loses its shape and alignment",Rheumatoid arthritis
"Doctors don't know what starts this process, although a genetic component appears likely",Rheumatoid arthritis
"While your genes don't actually cause rheumatoid arthritis, they can make you more susceptible to environmental factors â€” such as infection with certain viruses and bacteria â€” that may trigger the disease",Rheumatoid arthritis
Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis,Rheumatoid arthritis
"Rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins between the ages of 40 and 60",Rheumatoid arthritis
Family history,Rheumatoid arthritis
"If a member of your family has rheumatoid arthritis, you may have an increased risk of the disease",Rheumatoid arthritis
"Cigarette smoking increases your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, particularly if you have a genetic predisposition for developing the disease",Rheumatoid arthritis
Smoking also appears to be associated with greater disease severity,Rheumatoid arthritis
Environmental exposures,Rheumatoid arthritis
"Although uncertain and poorly understood, some exposures such as asbestos or silica may increase the risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis",Rheumatoid arthritis
Emergency workers exposed to dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center are at higher risk of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis,Rheumatoid arthritis
Obesity,Rheumatoid arthritis
"People who are overweight or obese appear to be at somewhat higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, especially in women diagnosed with the disease when they were 55 or younger",Rheumatoid arthritis

"However, if you've never had scabies, it could take as long as six weeks for signs and symptoms to begin",Scabies
It's important to remember that you can still spread scabies even if you don't have any signs or symptoms yet,Scabies
"Many skin conditions, such as dermatitis or eczema, are associated with itching and small bumps on the skin",Scabies
Your doctor can help determine the exact cause and ensure that you receive proper treatment,Scabies
Bathing and over-the-counter preparations won't eliminate scabies,Scabies

Other signs and symptoms associated with scarlet fever include: Fever of 101 F (38,Scarlet fever
9 C) or higher Swollen or tender glands in the neck A red rash  ,Scarlet fever
Both sinusitis and migraine headache pain often gets worse when you bend forward,Sinus headaches
"Migraine can also be accompanied by various nasal signs and symptoms â€” including congestion, facial pressure and a clear, watery nasal discharge",Sinus headaches
"In fact, studies have shown that approximately 90 percent of people who see a doctor for sinus headaches are found to have migraines instead",Sinus headaches
"Sinusitis, however, usually isn't associated with nausea or vomiting or aggravated by noise or bright light â€” all common features of migraines",Sinus headaches
"Sinusitis usually occurs after a viral upper respiratory infection or cold and includes thick, discolored nasal mucus, decreased sense of smell, and pain in one cheek or upper teeth",Sinus headaches

"Another rare cause of a sore throat is a condition that occurs when the small cartilage lid that covers the windpipe swells, blocking airflow (epiglottitis)",Sore throat NOS
"Both causes can block the airway, creating a medical emergency",Sore throat NOS
Your doctor will likely investigate more common causes of these signs and symptoms first,Stomach cancer
There is a strong correlation between a diet high in smoked and salted foods and stomach cancer,Stomach cancer
"As the use of refrigeration for preserving foods has increased around the world, the rates of stomach cancer have declined",Stomach cancer
"In general, cancer begins when an error (mutation) occurs in a cell's DNA",Stomach cancer
The mutation causes the cell to grow and divide at a rapid rate and to continue living when a normal cell would die,Stomach cancer
The accumulating cancerous cells form a tumor that can invade nearby structures,Stomach cancer
And cancer cells can break off from the tumor to spread throughout the body,Stomach cancer
Types of stomach cancer The cells that form the tumor determine the type of stomach cancer,Stomach cancer
The type of cells in your stomach cancer helps determine your treatment options,Stomach cancer
Types of stomach cancer include: Cancer that begins in the glandular cells (adenocarcinoma),Stomach cancer
The glandular cells that line the inside of the stomach secrete a protective layer of mucus to shield the lining of the stomach from the acidic digestive juices,Stomach cancer
Adenocarcinoma accounts for the great majority of all stomach cancers,Stomach cancer
Cancer that begins in immune system cells (lymphoma),Stomach cancer
The walls of the stomach contain a small number of immune system cells that can develop cancer,Stomach cancer
Lymphoma in the stomach is rare,Stomach cancer
Cancer that begins in hormone-producing cells (carcinoid cancer),Stomach cancer
Hormone-producing cells can develop carcinoid cancer,Stomach cancer
Carcinoid cancer in the stomach is rare,Stomach cancer
Cancer that begins in nervous system tissues,Stomach cancer
A gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) begins in specific nervous system cells found in your stomach,Stomach cancer
GIST is a rare form of stomach cancer,Stomach cancer
"Because the other types of stomach cancer are rare, when people use the term stomach cancer they generally are referring to adenocarcinoma",Stomach cancer
The cause of these signs and symptoms could be a viral infection or some other illness,Strep throat
That's why your doctor generally tests specifically for strep throat,Strep throat
It's also possible for you to be exposed to a person who carries strep but shows no symptoms,Strep throat
Streptococcal bacteria are highly contagious,Strep throat
"They can spread through airborne droplets when someone with the infection coughs or sneezes, or through shared food or drinks",Strep throat
"You can also pick up the bacteria from a doorknob or other surface and transfer them to your nose, mouth or eyes",Strep throat
Strep throat occurs most commonly in children,Strep throat
Time of year,Strep throat
"Although strep throat can occur anytime, it tends to circulate in late fall and early spring",Strep throat
Strep bacteria flourish wherever groups of people are in close contact,Strep throat
Antibiotic treatment reduces the risk,Strep throat
"Spread of infection Strep bacteria may spread, causing infection in: Tonsils Sinuses Skin Blood Middle ear Inflammatory reactions Strep infection may lead to inflammatory illnesses, including: Scarlet fever, a streptococcal infection characterized by a prominent rash Inflammation of the kidney (poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis) Rheumatic fever, a serious inflammatory condition that can affect the heart, joints, nervous system and skin Researchers are investigating a possible link between strep infection and a rare condition called pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with group A streptococci (PANDAS)",Strep throat
"PANDAS is a term used to describe certain children whose symptoms of neuropsychiatric conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder or tic disorders, are worsened by strep infection",Strep throat
The tenderness usually originates from a specific spot and decreases during rest,Stress fracture
You might have swelling around the painful area,Stress fracture
"Bone adapts gradually to increased loads through remodeling, a normal process that speeds up when the load on the bone increases",Stress fracture
"During remodeling, bone tissue is destroyed (resorption), then rebuilt",Stress fracture
"Bones subjected to unaccustomed force without enough time for recovery resorb cells faster than your body can replace them, which makes you more susceptible to stress fractures",Stress fracture
"Stress fractures are more common in people who participate in sports such as track and field, basketball, tennis, dance or gymnastics",Stress fracture
Increased activity,Stress fracture
"Stress fractures often occur in people who suddenly shift from a sedentary lifestyle to an active training regimen or who rapidly increase the intensity, duration or frequency of training sessions",Stress fracture
Sex,Stress fracture
"Women, especially those who have abnormal or absent menstrual periods, are at higher risk of developing stress fractures",Stress fracture
Foot problems,Stress fracture
"People who have flat feet or high, rigid arches are more likely to develop stress fractures",Stress fracture
Worn footwear contributes to the problem,Stress fracture
Weakened bones,Stress fracture
Conditions such as osteoporosis can weaken your bones and make it easier for stress fractures to occur,Stress fracture
Previous stress fractures,Stress fracture
Having had one or more stress fractures puts you at higher risk of having more,Stress fracture
Lack of nutrients,Stress fracture
Eating disorders and lack of vitamin D and calcium can make bones more likely to develop stress fractures,Stress fracture
"If underlying causes are not addressed, you may be at higher risk of additional stress fractures",Stress fracture
"Note when your signs and symptoms begin, because the length of time they have been present may guide your treatment decisions: Trouble with speaking and understanding",Stroke
You may experience confusion,Stroke
You may slur your words or have difficulty understanding speech,Stroke
"Paralysis or numbness of the face, arm or leg",Stroke
"You may develop sudden numbness, weakness or paralysis in your face, arm or leg, especially on one side of your body",Stroke
Try to raise both your arms over your head at the same time,Stroke
"If one arm begins to fall, you may be having a stroke",Stroke
"Similarly, one side of your mouth may droop when you try to smile",Stroke
Trouble with seeing in one or both eyes,Stroke
"You may suddenly have blurred or blackened vision in one or both eyes, or you may see double",Stroke
Headache,Stroke
"A sudden, severe headache, which may be accompanied by vomiting, dizziness or altered consciousness, may indicate you're having a stroke",Stroke
Trouble with walking,Stroke
"You may stumble or experience sudden dizziness, loss of balance or loss of coordination",Stroke
Think FAST and do the following: Face,Stroke
Ask the person to smile,Stroke
Does one side of the face droop? Ask the person to smile,Stroke
Does one side of the face droop? Arms,Stroke
Ask the person to raise both arms,Stroke
Does one arm drift downward? Or is one arm unable to raise up? Ask the person to raise both arms,Stroke
Does one arm drift downward? Or is one arm unable to raise up? Speech,Stroke
Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase,Stroke
Is his or her speech slurred or strange? Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase,Stroke
Is his or her speech slurred or strange? Time,Stroke
"If you observe any of these signs, call 911 immediately",Stroke
Call 911 or your local emergency number right away,Stroke
Don't wait to see if symptoms go away,Stroke
Every minute counts,Stroke
"The longer a stroke goes untreated, the greater the potential for brain damage and disability",Stroke
"If you're with someone you suspect is having a stroke, watch the person carefully while waiting for emergency assistance",Stroke
"This deprives your brain of oxygen and nutrients, which can cause your brain cells to die",Stroke
A stroke may be caused by a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or the leaking or bursting of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke),Stroke
"Some people may experience only a temporary disruption of blood flow to their brain (transient ischemic attack, or TIA)",Stroke
Ischemic stroke About 85 percent of strokes are ischemic strokes,Stroke
"Ischemic strokes occur when the arteries to your brain become narrowed or blocked, causing severely reduced blood flow (ischemia)",Stroke
The most common ischemic strokes include: Thrombotic stroke,Stroke
A thrombotic stroke occurs when a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one of the arteries that supply blood to your brain,Stroke
A clot may be caused by fatty deposits (plaque) that build up in arteries and cause reduced blood flow (atherosclerosis) or other artery conditions,Stroke
Embolic stroke,Stroke
An embolic stroke occurs when a blood clot or other debris forms away from your brain â€” commonly in your heart â€” and is swept through your bloodstream to lodge in narrower brain arteries,Stroke
This type of blood clot is called an embolus,Stroke
Hemorrhagic stroke Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in your brain leaks or ruptures,Stroke
"Brain hemorrhages can result from many conditions that affect your blood vessels, including uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension), overtreatment with anticoagulants and weak spots in your blood vessel walls (aneurysms)",Stroke
A less common cause of hemorrhage is the rupture of an abnormal tangle of thin-walled blood vessels (arteriovenous malformation) present at birth,Stroke
Types of hemorrhagic stroke include: Intracerebral hemorrhage,Stroke
"In an intracerebral hemorrhage, a blood vessel in the brain bursts and spills into the surrounding brain tissue, damaging brain cells",Stroke
Brain cells beyond the leak are deprived of blood and also damaged,Stroke
"High blood pressure, trauma, vascular malformations, use of blood-thinning medications and other conditions may cause an intracerebral hemorrhage",Stroke
Subarachnoid hemorrhage,Stroke
"In a subarachnoid hemorrhage, an artery on or near the surface of your brain bursts and spills into the space between the surface of your brain and your skull",Stroke
"This bleeding is often signaled by a sudden, severe headache",Stroke
A subarachnoid hemorrhage is commonly caused by the bursting of a small sack-shaped or berry-shaped outpouching on an artery known as an aneurysm,Stroke
"After the hemorrhage, the blood vessels in your brain may widen and narrow erratically (vasospasm), causing brain cell damage by further limiting blood flow",Stroke
Ischemic stroke Ischemic stroke Transient ischemic attack (TIA) A transient ischemic attack (TIA) â€” also known as a ministroke â€” is a brief period of symptoms similar to those you'd have in a stroke,Stroke
"A temporary decrease in blood supply to part of your brain causes TIAs, which often last less than five minutes",Stroke
"Like an ischemic stroke, a TIA occurs when a clot or debris blocks blood flow to part of your brain",Stroke
A TIA doesn't leave lasting symptoms because the blockage is temporary,Stroke
Seek emergency care even if your symptoms seem to clear up,Stroke
"Having a TIA puts you at greater risk of having a full-blown stroke, causing permanent damage later",Stroke
"If you've had a TIA, it means there's likely a partially blocked or narrowed artery leading to your brain or a clot source in the heart",Stroke
It's not possible to tell if you're having a stroke or a TIA based only on your symptoms,Stroke
Up to half of people whose symptoms appear to go away actually have had a stroke causing brain damage,Stroke
Some factors can also increase your chances of having a heart attack,Stroke
Potentially treatable stroke risk factors include: Lifestyle risk factors Being overweight or obese Physical inactivity Heavy or binge drinking Use of illicit drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamines Medical risk factors High blood pressure â€” the risk of stroke begins to increase at blood pressure readings higher than 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg),Stroke
"Your doctor will help you decide on a target blood pressure based on your age, whether you have diabetes and other factors",Stroke
Cigarette smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke,Stroke
High cholesterol,Stroke
Diabetes,Stroke
Obstructive sleep apnea â€” a sleep disorder in which the oxygen level intermittently drops during the night,Stroke
"Cardiovascular disease, including heart failure, heart defects, heart infection or abnormal heart rhythm",Stroke
"Other factors associated with a higher risk of stroke include: Personal or family history of stroke, heart attack or transient ischemic attack",Stroke
Being age 55 or older,Stroke
Race â€” African-Americans have a higher risk of stroke than do people of other races,Stroke
Gender â€” Men have a higher risk of stroke than women,Stroke
"Women are usually older when they have strokes, and they're more likely to die of strokes than are men",Stroke
"Also, they may have some risk from some birth control pills or hormone therapies that include estrogen, as well as from pregnancy and childbirth",Stroke
"You may become paralyzed on one side of your body, or lose control of certain muscles, such as those on one side of your face or one arm",Stroke
"Physical therapy may help you return to activities hampered by paralysis, such as walking, eating and dressing",Stroke
Difficulty talking or swallowing,Stroke
"A stroke may cause you to have less control over the way the muscles in your mouth and throat move, making it difficult for you to talk clearly (dysarthria), swallow or eat (dysphagia)",Stroke
"You also may have difficulty with language (aphasia), including speaking or understanding speech, reading or writing",Stroke
Therapy with a speech and language pathologist may help,Stroke
Memory loss or thinking difficulties,Stroke
Many people who have had strokes experience some memory loss,Stroke
"Others may have difficulty thinking, making judgments, reasoning and understanding concepts",Stroke
Emotional problems,Stroke
"People who have had strokes may have more difficulty controlling their emotions, or they may develop depression",Stroke
"People who have had strokes may have pain, numbness or other strange sensations in parts of their bodies affected by stroke",Stroke
"For example, if a stroke causes you to lose feeling in your left arm, you may develop an uncomfortable tingling sensation in that arm",Stroke
"People also may be sensitive to temperature changes, especially extreme cold after a stroke",Stroke
This complication is known as central stroke pain or central pain syndrome,Stroke
"This condition generally develops several weeks after a stroke, and it may improve over time",Stroke
"But because the pain is caused by a problem in your brain, rather than a physical injury, there are few treatments",Stroke
Changes in behavior and self-care ability,Stroke
People who have had strokes may become more withdrawn and less social or more impulsive,Stroke
They may need help with grooming and daily chores,Stroke
"As with any brain injury, the success of treating these complications will vary from person to person",Stroke
Many lymph nodes are located in your head and neck region,Swollen lymph nodes
"Lymph nodes that frequently swell are in this area, as well as in your armpits and groin area",Swollen lymph nodes
Swollen lymph nodes are a sign that something is wrong somewhere in your body,Swollen lymph nodes
"See your doctor if you're concerned or if your swollen lymph nodes: Have appeared for no apparent reason Continue to enlarge or have been present for two to four weeks Feel hard or rubbery, or don't move when you push on them Are accompanied by persistent fever, night sweats or unexplained weight loss Seek immediate medical care if you're having difficulty swallowing or breathing",Swollen lymph nodes
"The cells are a combination of lymphocytes â€” which produce protein particles that capture invaders, such as viruses â€” and macrophages, which break down the captured material",Swollen lymph nodes
Lymphocytes and macrophages filter your lymphatic fluid as it travels through your body and protect you by destroying invaders,Swollen lymph nodes
"Lymph nodes are located in groups, and each group drains a specific area of your body",Swollen lymph nodes
"You may be more likely to notice swelling in certain areas, such as in the lymph nodes in your neck, under your chin, in your armpits and in your groin",Swollen lymph nodes
The site of the swollen lymph nodes may help identify the underlying cause,Swollen lymph nodes
"The most common cause of swollen lymph nodes is an infection, particularly a viral infection, such as the common cold",Swollen lymph nodes
Prompt treatment can prevent severe damage or loss of your testicle if you have testicular torsion,Testicular torsion
You also need to seek prompt medical help if you've had sudden testicle pain that goes away without treatment,Testicular torsion
This can occur when a testicle twists and then untwists on its own (intermittent torsion and detorsion),Testicular torsion
Surgery is frequently needed to prevent the problem from happening again,Testicular torsion
The average incubation period is seven to 10 days,Tetanus
"If you aren't sure of when your last booster was, get a booster",Tetanus
"Or see your doctor about a tetanus booster for any wound â€” especially if it might have been contaminated with dirt, animal feces or manure â€” if you haven't had a booster shot within the past 10 years or aren't sure of when you were last vaccinated",Tetanus
"When they enter a deep flesh wound, spores grow into bacteria that can produce a powerful toxin, tetanospasmin, which impairs the nerves that control your muscles (motor neurons)",Tetanus
The toxin can cause muscle stiffness and spasms â€” the major signs of tetanus,Tetanus
Nearly all cases of tetanus occur in people who have never been vaccinated or adults who haven't kept up with their 10-year booster shots,Tetanus
You can't catch tetanus from a person who has it,Tetanus
"Complete recovery from a tetanus infection requires new nerve endings to grow, which can take up to several months",Tetanus
"Tinnitus symptoms include these types of phantom noises in your ears: Ringing Buzzing Roaring Clicking Hissing The phantom noise may vary in pitch from a low roar to a high squeal, and you may hear it in one or both ears",Tinnitus NOS
"In some cases, the sound can be so loud it can interfere with your ability to concentrate or hear actual sound",Tinnitus NOS
"Tinnitus may be present all the time, or it may come and go",Tinnitus NOS
There are two kinds of tinnitus,Tinnitus NOS
Subjective tinnitus is tinnitus only you can hear,Tinnitus NOS
This is the most common type of tinnitus,Tinnitus NOS
"It can be caused by ear problems in your outer, middle or inner ear",Tinnitus NOS
It also can be caused by problems with the hearing (auditory) nerves or the part of your brain that interprets nerve signals as sound (auditory pathways),Tinnitus NOS
is tinnitus only you can hear,Tinnitus NOS
Objective tinnitus is tinnitus your doctor can hear when he or she does an examination,Tinnitus NOS
"This rare type of tinnitus may be caused by a blood vessel problem, a middle ear bone condition or muscle contractions",Tinnitus NOS
"Make an appointment to see your doctor if: You develop tinnitus after an upper respiratory infection, such as a cold, and your tinnitus doesn't improve within a week",Tinnitus NOS
See your doctor as soon as possible if: You have tinnitus that occurs suddenly or without an apparent cause,Tinnitus NOS
You have hearing loss or dizziness with the tinnitus,Tinnitus NOS
"In many cases, an exact cause is never found",Tinnitus NOS
A common cause of tinnitus is inner ear cell damage,Tinnitus NOS
"Tiny, delicate hairs in your inner ear move in relation to the pressure of sound waves",Tinnitus NOS
This triggers ear cells to release an electrical signal through a nerve from your ear (auditory nerve) to your brain,Tinnitus NOS
Your brain interprets these signals as sound,Tinnitus NOS
"If the hairs inside your inner ear are bent or broken, they can leak random electrical impulses to your brain, causing tinnitus",Tinnitus NOS
"Other causes of tinnitus include other ear problems, chronic health conditions, and injuries or conditions that affect the nerves in your ear or the hearing center in your brain",Tinnitus NOS
"Common causes of tinnitus In many people, tinnitus is caused by one of these conditions: Age-related hearing loss",Tinnitus NOS
"For many people, hearing worsens with age, usually starting around age 60",Tinnitus NOS
Hearing loss can cause tinnitus,Tinnitus NOS
The medical term for this type of hearing loss is presbycusis,Tinnitus NOS
Exposure to loud noise,Tinnitus NOS
"Loud noises, such as those from heavy equipment, chain saws and firearms, are common sources of noise-related hearing loss",Tinnitus NOS
"Portable music devices, such as MP3 players or iPods, also can cause noise-related hearing loss if played loudly for long periods",Tinnitus NOS
"Tinnitus caused by short-term exposure, such as attending a loud concert, usually goes away; long-term exposure to loud sound can cause permanent damage",Tinnitus NOS
Earwax blockage,Tinnitus NOS
Earwax protects your ear canal by trapping dirt and slowing the growth of bacteria,Tinnitus NOS
"When too much earwax accumulates, it becomes too hard to wash away naturally, causing hearing loss or irritation of the eardrum, which can lead to tinnitus",Tinnitus NOS
Ear bone changes,Tinnitus NOS
Stiffening of the bones in your middle ear (otosclerosis) may affect your hearing and cause tinnitus,Tinnitus NOS
"This condition, caused by abnormal bone growth, tends to run in families",Tinnitus NOS
"Other causes of tinnitus Some causes of tinnitus are less common, including: Meniere's disease",Tinnitus NOS
"Tinnitus can be an early indicator of Meniere's disease, an inner ear disorder that may be caused by abnormal inner ear fluid pressure",Tinnitus NOS
TMJ disorders,Tinnitus NOS
"Problems with the temporomandibular joint, the joint on each side of your head in front of your ears, where your lower jawbone meets your skull, can cause tinnitus",Tinnitus NOS
Head injuries or neck injuries,Tinnitus NOS
"Head or neck trauma can affect the inner ear, hearing nerves or brain function linked to hearing",Tinnitus NOS
Such injuries generally cause tinnitus in only one ear,Tinnitus NOS
Acoustic neuroma,Tinnitus NOS
This noncancerous (benign) tumor develops on the cranial nerve that runs from your brain to your inner ear and controls balance and hearing,Tinnitus NOS
"Also called vestibular schwannoma, this condition generally causes tinnitus in only one ear",Tinnitus NOS
"Blood vessel disorders linked to tinnitus In rare cases, tinnitus is caused by a blood vessel disorder",Tinnitus NOS
This type of tinnitus is called pulsatile tinnitus,Tinnitus NOS
"With age and buildup of cholesterol and other deposits, major blood vessels close to your middle and inner ear lose some of their elasticity â€” the ability to flex or expand slightly with each heartbeat",Tinnitus NOS
"That causes blood flow to become more forceful, making it easier for your ear to detect the beats",Tinnitus NOS
You can generally hear this type of tinnitus in both ears,Tinnitus NOS
Head and neck tumors,Tinnitus NOS
A tumor that presses on blood vessels in your head or neck (vascular neoplasm) can cause tinnitus and other symptoms,Tinnitus NOS
High blood pressure,Tinnitus NOS
"Hypertension and factors that increase blood pressure, such as stress, alcohol and caffeine, can make tinnitus more noticeable",Tinnitus NOS
Turbulent blood flow,Tinnitus NOS
"Narrowing or kinking in a neck artery (carotid artery) or vein in your neck (jugular vein) can cause turbulent, irregular blood flow, leading to tinnitus",Tinnitus NOS
Malformation of capillaries,Tinnitus NOS
"A condition called arteriovenous malformation (AVM), abnormal connections between arteries and veins, can result in tinnitus",Tinnitus NOS
This type of tinnitus generally occurs in only one ear,Tinnitus NOS
Medications that can cause tinnitus A number of medications may cause or worsen tinnitus,Tinnitus NOS
"Generally, the higher the dose of these medications, the worse tinnitus becomes",Tinnitus NOS
Often the unwanted noise disappears when you stop using these drugs,Tinnitus NOS
Prolonged exposure to loud noise can damage the tiny sensory hair cells in your ear that transmit sound to your brain,Tinnitus NOS
"People who work in noisy environments â€” such as factory and construction workers, musicians, and soldiers â€” are particularly at risk",Tinnitus NOS
"As you age, the number of functioning nerve fibers in your ears declines, possibly causing hearing problems often associated with tinnitus",Tinnitus NOS
Most cases improve within one to two days without treatment and clear up completely within a week,Traveler's diarrhea
"However, you can have multiple episodes of traveler's diarrhea during one trip",Traveler's diarrhea
"The most common signs and symptoms of traveler's diarrhea are: Abrupt onset of passage of three or more loose stools a day An urgent need to defecate Abdominal cramps Nausea Vomiting Fever Sometimes, people experience moderate to severe dehydration, persistent vomiting, a high fever, bloody stools, or severe pain in the abdomen or rectum",Traveler's diarrhea
"If you or your child experiences any of these signs or symptoms or if the diarrhea lasts longer than a few days, it's time to see a doctor",Traveler's diarrhea
Signs and symptoms may last longer and be more severe if the condition is caused by organisms other than common bacteria,Traveler's diarrhea
"In such cases, you may need prescription medications to help you get better",Traveler's diarrhea
"If you have severe dehydration, persistent vomiting, bloody stools or a high fever, or if your symptoms last for more than a few days, seek medical help",Traveler's diarrhea
The local embassy or consulate may be able to help you find a well-regarded medical professional who speaks your language,Traveler's diarrhea
Be especially cautious with children because traveler's diarrhea can cause severe dehydration in a short time,Traveler's diarrhea
But almost always an infectious agent is to blame,Traveler's diarrhea
You typically develop traveler's diarrhea after ingesting food or water that's contaminated with organisms from feces,Traveler's diarrhea
"These organisms are infectious agents â€” including various bacteria, viruses and parasites â€” that enter your digestive tract and overpower your defense mechanisms, resulting in signs and symptoms of traveler's diarrhea",Traveler's diarrhea
The most common cause of traveler's diarrhea is enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) bacteria,Traveler's diarrhea
These bacteria attach themselves to the lining of your intestine and release a toxin that causes diarrhea and abdominal cramps,Traveler's diarrhea
So why aren't natives of high-risk countries affected in the same way? Often their bodies have become accustomed to the bacteria and have developed immunity to them,Traveler's diarrhea
"High-risk destinations for traveler's diarrhea include many areas of Central and South America, Mexico, Africa, the Middle East and most of Asia",Traveler's diarrhea
Traveling to Eastern Europe and a few Caribbean islands also poses some risk,Traveler's diarrhea
"However, your risk of traveler's diarrhea is generally low in Northern and Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States",Traveler's diarrhea
Your chances of getting traveler's diarrhea are mostly determined by your destination,Traveler's diarrhea
But certain groups of people have a greater risk of developing the condition,Traveler's diarrhea
These include: Young adults,Traveler's diarrhea
The condition is slightly more common in young adult tourists,Traveler's diarrhea
"Though the reasons why aren't clear, it's possible that young adults lack acquired immunity",Traveler's diarrhea
"They may also be more adventurous than older people in their travels and dietary choices, or they may be less vigilant in avoiding contaminated foods",Traveler's diarrhea
People with weakened immune systems,Traveler's diarrhea
A weakened immune system increases vulnerability to infections,Traveler's diarrhea
"People with diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease or cirrhosis of the liver",Traveler's diarrhea
These conditions can leave you more prone to infection or increase your risk of a more-severe infection,Traveler's diarrhea
People who take acid blockers or antacids,Traveler's diarrhea
"Acid in the stomach tends to destroy organisms, so a reduction in stomach acid may leave more opportunity for bacterial survival",Traveler's diarrhea
People who travel during certain seasons,Traveler's diarrhea
The risk of traveler's diarrhea varies by season in certain parts of the world,Traveler's diarrhea
"For example, risk is highest in South Asia during the hot months just before the monsoons",Traveler's diarrhea
"Dehydration is especially dangerous for children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems",Traveler's diarrhea
"Dehydration caused by diarrhea can cause serious complications, including organ damage, shock or coma",Traveler's diarrhea
"Signs and symptoms of dehydration include a very dry mouth, intense thirst, little or no urination, and extreme weakness",Traveler's diarrhea
"For this reason, doctors make a distinction between: Latent TB",Tuberculosis
"In this condition, you have a TB infection, but the bacteria remain in your body in an inactive state and cause no symptoms",Tuberculosis
"Latent TB, also called inactive TB or TB infection, isn't contagious",Tuberculosis
"It can turn into active TB, so treatment is important for the person with latent TB and to help control the spread of TB",Tuberculosis
An estimated 2 billion people have latent TB,Tuberculosis
Active TB,Tuberculosis
This condition makes you sick and can spread to others,Tuberculosis
"It can occur in the first few weeks after infection with the TB bacteria, or it might occur years later",Tuberculosis
"Signs and symptoms of active TB include: Coughing that lasts three or more weeks Coughing up blood Chest pain, or pain with breathing or coughing Unintentional weight loss Fatigue Fever Night sweats Chills Loss of appetite Tuberculosis can also affect other parts of your body, including your kidneys, spine or brain",Tuberculosis
"When TB occurs outside your lungs, signs and symptoms vary according to the organs involved",Tuberculosis
"For example, tuberculosis of the spine may give you back pain, and tuberculosis in your kidneys might cause blood in your urine",Tuberculosis
"These are often signs of TB, but they can also result from other medical problems",Tuberculosis
Your doctor can perform tests to help determine the cause,Tuberculosis
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people who have an increased risk of tuberculosis be screened for latent TB infection,Tuberculosis
"This can happen when someone with the untreated, active form of tuberculosis coughs, speaks, sneezes, spits, laughs or sings",Tuberculosis
"Although tuberculosis is contagious, it's not easy to catch",Tuberculosis
You're much more likely to get tuberculosis from someone you live with or work with than from a stranger,Tuberculosis
Most people with active TB who've had appropriate drug treatment for at least two weeks are no longer contagious,Tuberculosis
"HIV and TB Since the 1980s, the number of cases of tuberculosis has increased dramatically because of the spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS",Tuberculosis
"Infection with HIV suppresses the immune system, making it difficult for the body to control TB bacteria",Tuberculosis
"As a result, people with HIV are many times more likely to get TB and to progress from latent to active disease than are people who aren't HIV positive",Tuberculosis
Drug-resistant TB Another reason tuberculosis remains a major killer is the increase in drug-resistant strains of the bacterium,Tuberculosis
"Since the first antibiotics were used to fight tuberculosis more than 60 years ago, some TB germs have developed the ability to survive, and that ability gets passed on to their descendants",Tuberculosis
Drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis emerge when an antibiotic fails to kill all of the bacteria it targets,Tuberculosis
The surviving bacteria become resistant to that particular drug and frequently other antibiotics as well,Tuberculosis
"Some TB bacteria have developed resistance to the most commonly used treatments, such as isoniazid and rifampin",Tuberculosis
"Some strains of TB have also developed resistance to drugs less commonly used in TB treatment, such as the antibiotics known as fluoroquinolones, and injectable medications including amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin",Tuberculosis
These medications are often used to treat infections that are resistant to the more commonly used drugs,Tuberculosis
"These factors include: Weakened immune system A healthy immune system often successfully fights TB bacteria, but your body can't mount an effective defense if your resistance is low",Tuberculosis
"A number of diseases and medications can weaken your immune system, including: HIV/AIDS Diabetes Severe kidney disease Certain cancers Cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy Drugs to prevent rejection of transplanted organs Some drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and psoriasis Malnutrition Very young or advanced age Traveling or living in certain areas The risk of contracting tuberculosis is higher for people who live in or travel to countries that have high rates of tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis, including: Africa Eastern Europe Asia Russia Latin America Caribbean Islands Poverty and substance abuse Lack of medical care",Tuberculosis
"If you receive a low or fixed income, live in a remote area, have recently immigrated to the United States, or are homeless, you may lack access to the medical care needed to diagnose and treat TB",Tuberculosis
Substance abuse,Tuberculosis
IV drug use or alcohol abuse weakens your immune system and makes you more vulnerable to tuberculosis,Tuberculosis
Tobacco use,Tuberculosis
Using tobacco greatly increases the risk of getting TB and dying of it,Tuberculosis
Where you work or live Health care work,Tuberculosis
Regular contact with people who are ill increases your chances of exposure to TB bacteria,Tuberculosis
Wearing a mask and frequent hand-washing greatly reduce your risk,Tuberculosis
Living or working in a residential care facility,Tuberculosis
"People who live or work in prisons, immigration centers or nursing homes are all at a higher risk of tuberculosis",Tuberculosis
That's because the risk of the disease is higher anywhere there is overcrowding and poor ventilation,Tuberculosis
Living in a refugee camp or shelter,Tuberculosis
"Weakened by poor nutrition and ill health and living in crowded, unsanitary conditions, refugees are at especially high risk of tuberculosis infection",Tuberculosis
"Untreated active disease typically affects your lungs, but it can spread to other parts of your body through your bloodstream",Tuberculosis
Examples of tuberculosis complications include:,Tuberculosis
"In fact, you can have type 2 diabetes for years and not know it",Type 2 diabetes
Look for: Increased thirst and frequent urination,Type 2 diabetes
Excess sugar building up in your bloodstream causes fluid to be pulled from the tissues,Type 2 diabetes
This may leave you thirsty,Type 2 diabetes
"As a result, you may drink â€” and urinate â€” more than usual",Type 2 diabetes
Increased hunger,Type 2 diabetes
"Without enough insulin to move sugar into your cells, your muscles and organs become depleted of energy",Type 2 diabetes
"Despite eating more than usual to relieve hunger, you may lose weight",Type 2 diabetes
"Without the ability to metabolize glucose, the body uses alternative fuels stored in muscle and fat",Type 2 diabetes
Calories are lost as excess glucose is released in the urine,Type 2 diabetes
"If your cells are deprived of sugar, you may become tired and irritable",Type 2 diabetes
"If your blood sugar is too high, fluid may be pulled from the lenses of your eyes",Type 2 diabetes
This may affect your ability to focus,Type 2 diabetes
Slow-healing sores or frequent infections,Type 2 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes affects your ability to heal and resist infections,Type 2 diabetes
Areas of darkened skin,Type 2 diabetes
"Some people with type 2 diabetes have patches of dark, velvety skin in the folds and creases of their bodies â€” usually in the armpits and neck",Type 2 diabetes
"This condition, called acanthosis nigricans, may be a sign of insulin resistance",Type 2 diabetes
"Exactly why this happens is unknown, although genetics and environmental factors, such as excess weight and inactivity, seem to be contributing factors",Type 2 diabetes
How insulin works Insulin is a hormone that comes from the gland situated behind and below the stomach (pancreas),Type 2 diabetes
The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream,Type 2 diabetes
"The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells",Type 2 diabetes
Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream,Type 2 diabetes
"As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas",Type 2 diabetes
The role of glucose Glucose â€” a sugar â€” is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues,Type 2 diabetes
Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver,Type 2 diabetes
"Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin",Type 2 diabetes
Your liver stores and makes glucose,Type 2 diabetes
"When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range",Type 2 diabetes
"In type 2 diabetes, this process doesn't work well",Type 2 diabetes
"Instead of moving into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream",Type 2 diabetes
"As blood sugar levels increase, the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas release more insulin, but eventually these cells become impaired and can't make enough insulin to meet the body's demands",Type 2 diabetes
"In the much less common type 1 diabetes, the immune system destroys the beta cells, leaving the body with little to no insulin",Type 2 diabetes
"It's clear, however, that certain factors increase the risk, including: Weight",Type 2 diabetes
Being overweight is a primary risk factor for type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes
"The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin",Type 2 diabetes
"However, you don't have to be overweight to develop type 2 diabetes",Type 2 diabetes
Fat distribution,Type 2 diabetes
"If your body stores fat primarily in your abdomen, your risk of type 2 diabetes is greater than if your body stores fat elsewhere, such as your hips and thighs",Type 2 diabetes
Inactivity,Type 2 diabetes
"The less active you are, the greater your risk of type 2 diabetes",Type 2 diabetes
"Early illness Once signs and symptoms do appear, you're likely to experience: Fever that starts low and increases daily, possibly reaching as high as 104",Typhoid fever
Consulate for a list of doctors,Typhoid fever
"Better yet, find out in advance about medical care in the areas you'll visit, and carry a list of the names, addresses and phone numbers of recommended doctors",Typhoid fever
"If you develop signs and symptoms after you return home, consider consulting a doctor who focuses on international travel medicine or infectious diseases",Typhoid fever
A specialist may be able to recognize and treat your illness more quickly than can a doctor who isn't familiar with these areas,Typhoid fever
"Since vaginal cancer doesn't always cause signs and symptoms, follow your doctor's recommendations about when you should have routine pelvic exams",Vaginal cancer
"In general, cancer begins when healthy cells acquire a genetic mutation that turns normal cells into abnormal cells",Vaginal cancer
"Healthy cells grow and multiply at a set rate, eventually dying at a set time",Vaginal cancer
"Cancer cells grow and multiply out of control, and they don't die",Vaginal cancer
The accumulating abnormal cells form a mass (tumor),Vaginal cancer
Cancer cells invade nearby tissues and can break off from an initial tumor to spread elsewhere in the body (metastasize),Vaginal cancer
Types of vaginal cancer Vaginal cancer is divided into different types based on the type of cell where the cancer began,Vaginal cancer
Your risk of vaginal cancer increases as you age,Vaginal cancer
Most people who are diagnosed with vaginal cancer are older than 60,Vaginal cancer
Atypical cells in the vagina called vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia,Vaginal cancer
Being diagnosed with vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) increases your risk of vaginal cancer,Vaginal cancer
"With VAIN, cells in the vagina appear different from normal cells, but not different enough to be considered cancer",Vaginal cancer
"A small number of those with VAIN will eventually develop vaginal cancer, though doctors aren't sure what causes some cases to develop into cancer and others to remain benign",Vaginal cancer
"VAIN is frequently caused by the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancers, among others",Vaginal cancer
Vaccines that prevent some types of HPV infection are available,Vaginal cancer
Exposure to miscarriage prevention drug,Vaginal cancer
If your mother took a drug called diethylstilbestrol (DES) while pregnant in the 1950s you may have an increased risk of a certain type of vaginal cancer called clear cell adenocarcinoma,Vaginal cancer
"They're usually mild at first and resemble those of a common cold: Runny nose Nasal congestion Red, watery eyes Fever Cough After a week or two, signs and symptoms worsen",Whooping cough
"Thick mucus accumulates inside your airways, causing uncontrollable coughing",Whooping cough
"Severe and prolonged coughing attacks may: Provoke vomiting Result in a red or blue face Cause extreme fatigue End with a high-pitched whoop sound during the next breath of air However, many people don't develop the characteristic whoop",Whooping cough
"Sometimes, a persistent hacking cough is the only sign that an adolescent or adult has whooping cough",Whooping cough
Infants may not cough at all,Whooping cough
"Instead, they may struggle to breathe, or they may even temporarily stop breathing",Whooping cough
"After this, the infection enters an acute phase and then, in some cases, a toxic phase that can be life-threatening",Yellow fever
"Acute phase Once the infection enters the acute phase, you may experience signs and symptoms including: Fever Headache Muscle aches, particularly in your back and knees Sensitivity to light Nausea, vomiting or both Loss of appetite Dizziness Red eyes, face or tongue These signs and symptoms usually improve and are gone within several days",Yellow fever
"Toxic phase Although signs and symptoms may disappear for a day or two following the acute phase, some people with acute yellow fever then enter a toxic phase",Yellow fever
"During the toxic phase, acute signs and symptoms return and more-severe and life-threatening ones also appear",Yellow fever
"These can include: Yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) Abdominal pain and vomiting, sometimes of blood Decreased urination Bleeding from your nose, mouth and eyes Slow heart rate (bradycardia) Liver and kidney failure Brain dysfunction, including delirium, seizures and coma The toxic phase of yellow fever can be fatal",Yellow fever
make an appointment to see your doctor if you're traveling to an area in which yellow fever is known to occur so that you discuss whether you need the yellow fever vaccine,Yellow fever
"If you have less than four weeks to prepare, call your doctor anyway",Yellow fever
"Ideally, you'll be able to be vaccinated at least three to four weeks before traveling to an area where yellow fever occurs to give the vaccine time to work",Yellow fever
Your doctor will help you determine whether you need vaccinations and can provide general guidance on protecting your health while abroad,Yellow fever
